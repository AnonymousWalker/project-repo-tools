Open Bible Stories Tools
========================

*These tools export and format content from the [Open Bible Stories](http://door43.org/en/obs/01-the-creation)
project. Note: 'templates' contains, not surprisingly, templates for formatting content on export from Door43.*

* **book** - exports Open Bible Stories as a (nearly) print-ready OpenDocument file.
* **markdown** - exports Open Bible Stories as markdown files.
* **plaintext** - exports Open Bible Stories as plaintext (and ODT w/o images).
