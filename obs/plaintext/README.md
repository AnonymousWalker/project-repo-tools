Plaintext Export
================

This script exports the content of [Open Bible Stories](http://door43.org/en/obs/01-the-creation) 
as text without images. 

Notes:

* Exported text is formatted in Markdown.
* Stories exist as standalone text files as well as a single, concatenated text file with all stories.
* The text is also converted to ODT (and potentially other formats as well).
