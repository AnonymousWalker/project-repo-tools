 <p>
  The &ldquo;translationAcademy&rdquo; is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of Biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  translationAcademy contains the following sections:
 </p>
 <ul>

 </ul>
 <p>
  Each manual is separated into two volumes. Volume 1 of each manual covers the basics of that subject while volume 2 goes more in depth. In general, if a module is needed to translate and publish Open Bible Stories, then it is included in volume 1, if not, then it is included in volume 2.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="why">Why</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples of EVERY people group:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-plugin">
  <p>
   &ldquo;Jesus came to them and spoke to them and said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey all the things that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.&rdquo; -Matthew 28:18-20 (ULB)
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  We have the promise that one day representatives from EVERY language will be in heaven:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-plugin">
  <p>
   &ldquo;After these things I saw, and behold, there was a great crowd, which no one was able to number, out of every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. &rdquo; -Revelation 7:9 (ULB)
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Understanding the WORD OF GOD in one's heart language is so important:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-plugin">
  <p>
   &ldquo;So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&rdquo; -Romans 10:17 (ULB)
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  So, why do we do what we do?
 </p>
 <p>
  The unfoldingWord project exists because every people group deserves to have the Word of God in their language. To this end we seek to make disciples of all nations by helping to provide
  <strong>
   unrestricted biblical content in every language of the world
  </strong>

<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="identifying-and-managing-translation-quality">Identifying and Managing Translation Quality</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The quality of a translation generally refers to the fidelity of the translation to the meaning of the original, and the degree to which the translation is understandable and effective for the speakers of the receptor language. The strategy we suggest involves checking the forms and communicative quality of the translation with the language community, and checking the fidelity of the translation with the Church in that people group.
 </p>
 <p>
  The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that has been reviewed by the speakers of the language community and also by the leadership of the church in the language group so that it is:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Accurate, Clear, Natural, and Equal
    </strong>
    &mdash; Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     <a class="wikilink1" href="#create-church-approved-translations" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_church_approved">

     </a>
    </strong>
    - Endorsed and used by the Church.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  We also recommend that the translation work be:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     <a class="wikilink1" href="/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_collaborative" title="en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_collaborative">
      Collaborative
     </a>
    </strong>
    &mdash; Where possible, work together with other believers who speak your language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the highest quality and available to as many people as possible.

      Ongoing
     </a>
    </strong>
    &mdash; Translation work is never completely finished. Encourage those who are skilled with the language to suggest better ways to say things when they notice that improvements can be made. Any errors in the translation should also be corrected as soon as they are discovered. Also encourage the periodic review of translations to ascertain when revision or a new translation is needed. We recommend that each language community form a translation committee to oversee this ongoing work. Using the unfoldingWord online tools, these changes to the translation can be made quickly and easily.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="explanation">Explanation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The objective of the gateway languages strategy is to equip 100% of the people groups that comprise the global Church with biblical content that is released from copyright restrictions and made available in a language they understand well (a language of wider communication) together with unrestricted translation training and tools that enable them to translate it into a language they understand fully (their own language). A &ldquo;gateway language&rdquo; is a language of wider communication through which second-language speakers of that language can gain access to content and translate it into their own language.
 </p>
 <p>
  The &ldquo;gateway languages&rdquo; at the world level comprise the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language, via translation by bilingual speakers. For example, French is a gateway language for minority languages in Francophone Africa in that content available in French can be translated by bilingual speakers from French into their own languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the country level, the gateway languages of a given country are the fewest languages of wider communication required for bilingual speakers in every minority language native to the country (not located there due to immigration) to gain access to content. For example, English is the gateway language for North Korea, given that all people groups native to North Korea can be reached by translation of content into their language from English.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="effects">Effects</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  This model has two basic effects: First, it empowers all languages to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; content to their language once the content and helps have been &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; into a language accessible to every language of the world (a gateway language). Second, it limits the amount of translation that needs to be done as the helps only have to be translated into the gateway language. All other languages can translate only the content as no language will be dependent upon them for understanding the translation helps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, depending on whether or not a language is a gateway language will determine what needs to be translated into that language.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Other Languages, we recommend they translate at least Open Bible Stories. They are welcome to translate whatever other resources they like.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Gateway Languages, we strongly recommend the following resources be translated, in this order and checked to the level specified:

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  <em>
   Note: These are terms that the Translation Manual will use to talk about language. The translator will need to understand these terms in order to use the Translation Manual.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Term
  </strong>
  - A word or phrase that refers to one thing, idea, or action. For example, the term in English for pouring liquid into one's mouth is &ldquo;drink.&rdquo; The term for a ceremony that marks an important transition in someone's life is &ldquo;rite of passage.&rdquo; The difference between a term and a word is that a term can contain several words.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Text
  </strong>
  - A text is something that a speaker or writer is communicating to a hearer or reader by means of language. The speaker or writer has a certain meaning in mind, and so he or she chooses a form of the language to express that meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Context
  </strong>
  - The words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs surrounding the word, phrase, or sentence in question. The context is the text that surrounds the part of the text that you are examining. The meaning of individual words and phrases can change when they are in different contexts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Form
  </strong>
  - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. &ldquo;Form&rdquo; refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Grammar
  </strong>
  - The way that sentences are put together in a language. This has to do with the order of its various parts, such as if the verb goes first or last or in the middle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Idiom
  </strong>
  - An expression that uses several words and that means something different as a whole than it would if the words were understood with the meanings that they have when they are used separately. Idioms cannot be translated literally, that is, with the meanings of the separate words. For example, &ldquo;He kicked the bucket&rdquo; is an idiom in English that means, &ldquo;He died.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meaning
  </strong>
  - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Translation
  </strong>
  - The act of expressing the meaning conveyed by the form of one language in the form of another language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Source Language
  </strong>
  - The language
  <em>
   from
  </em>
  which the translation is being made.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Source Text
  </strong>
  - The text
  <em>
   from
  </em>
  which the translation is being made.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Target Language
  </strong>
  - The language
  <em>
   into
  </em>
  which a translation is being made.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Target Text
  </strong>
  - The text being made by the translator as he or she translates the meaning from the source text.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Original Language
  </strong>
  - The language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Language of Wider Communication
  </strong>
  - A language that is spoken over a broad area and by many people. For most people, this is not their first language, but is the language that they use to speak to people outside of their language community. Some people call this a trade language. Most Bibles will be translated using a language of wider communication as the source language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Literal Translation
  </strong>
  - A translation that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes as a result.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Meaning-based Translation (or Dynamic Translation)
  </strong>
  - A translation that focuses on reproducing the meaning of the source text in the target text, even if the form changes as a result.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Passage
  </strong>
  - A section of the Bible text that is being talked about. This can be as small as one verse, but it is usually several verses that together have one topic or tell one story.

 <p>
  Translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language (the source language) into a different language (the target language).
 </p>
 <p>
  There are basically two kinds of translations: literal and dynamic (or meaning-based).
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Literal translations focus on representing words in the source language with words in the target language that have similar basic meanings. They also use phrases that have similar structures to the phrases in the source language. This kind of translation allows the reader to see the structure of the source text, but it often makes it difficult or impossible for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Dynamic, meaning-based translations focus on representing the meaning of the source language sentence in its context, and will use whatever words and phrase structures are most appropriate to convey that meaning in the target language. The goal of this kind of translation is to make it easy for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text. This is the kind of translation recommended in this Translation Manual.

  The Bible is the most influential book in history. It is God's message to mankind. Jesus commanded the Church to make disciples by teaching people from every nation to observe everything that is contained in it.
 </p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-plugin">
  <p>
   So go, and using my authority, teach my message to people of all ethnic groups so that they may become my disciples. Baptize them to be under the authority of my Father, and of me, his Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, until the end of this age. -Matthew 28:19-20 (UDB)
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The original Bible was written in ancient forms of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. Few people today understand any of those languages. Therefore, the Bible must be translated so they can read and understand it. People continue to translate the Bible into the languages of every people group so that God's message can change their lives.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="clear-translations">Clear Translations</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  To create a clear translation from the source text into your language:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    You may need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause if it is in some other form, such as an abstract noun.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    You may need to change passive verbs to the active form.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Look at each &ldquo;of&rdquo; phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by &ldquo;of.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="check-pronouns">Check Pronouns</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  You will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="identify-participants">Identify Participants</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Next you need to understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the PARTICIPANTS. The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things that take part in that event. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it are the main PARTICIPANTS. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="clearly-express-event-ideas">Clearly Express Event Ideas</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  A clear translation may need to express EVENT ideas as verbs. You may need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause to be sure it is understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. If, however, your language also uses nouns to express EVENT ideas and the event or action sounds more natural as a noun, then use the noun form.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="passive-verbs">Passive Verbs</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  A clear translation may need to change any PASSIVE verbs to the ACTIVE form.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ACTIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the PASSIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. For example, &ldquo;John hit Bill&rdquo; is an active sentence. &ldquo;Bill was hit by John&rdquo; is a passive sentence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many languages do not have a PASSIVE form, only the ACTIVE form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the PASSIVE form into the ACTIVE form.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="look-at-each-of-phrase">Look at Each 'Of' Phrase</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  To make a clear translation, you will also need to look at each &ldquo;of&rdquo; phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by &ldquo;of.&rdquo; In many languages, &ldquo;of&rdquo; constructions are not as frequent as they are in Greek, the original language of the New Testament books. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  To translate the Bible so that it is NATURAL means that:
 </p>
 <p>
  The translation should sound like it was written by a member of the target group&mdash;not by a foreigner.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order for a translation to sound natural, sometimes it is necessary to create shorter, simpler sentences from longer, complex ones. The Greek language often has long, grammatically complicated sentences. Some Bible translations follow the Greek structure closely and keep these long sentences in their translation, even when this does not sound natural or is confusing in the target language.
 </p>
 <p>
  When preparing to translate, it is often helpful to rewrite the passage, breaking long sentences up into shorter sentences. This can help you to see the meaning more clearly and translate it better. In many languages, it is good style to have shorter sentences, or, when sentences are longer, to avoid having complicated sentences. So in re-expressing the meaning in the Target Language, it is sometimes necessary to break up some of the original long sentences into several shorter sentences. Because many languages use sentences with only one or two clause groupings, the shorter sentences will give a sense of naturalness. The shorter sentences will also give readers a better understanding, because the meaning will be clearer. Be sure to include clear connection words between the new, shorter clauses and sentences.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make shorter sentences from longer, more complex sentences, identify the words in the sentence that relate directly to each other, that is, that belong together to form a clause. Generally, each verb or action word has words on either side of it that point back to or forward to the action of the verb. A grouping of words like this that can stand on its own may be written as an independent clause or a simple sentence. Keep each of those groups of words together and in that way divide the sentence into its separate ideas or parts. Then test your translation by reading it to a member of the language community to see if it sounds natural.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  A good translation will use the same vocabulary and expressions as the people of the target group normally use. It should be easy for them to read it or listen to it. There should not be any awkward or strange phrases. The translation should read as easily as a letter from a close friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also ask yourself the following questions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Have you effectively used punctuation to help a reader know when to pause or to breathe?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">

  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Have you followed the verse numbering of your source text and included it in your translation?
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>

  These points are important in keeping a translation natural.

 <p>
  To create an ACCURATE translation of the Bible means that the translation communicates the same message as the source. Here are some steps to follow:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Discover the meaning of a passage.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Identify the main idea.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Translate with the author&rsquo;s message in mind.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="discover-the-meaning">Discover the Meaning</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  First, read each passage a few times to discover the meaning. Use the two versions of the Bible available in translation Studio: the Unlocked Dynamic Bible and the Unlocked Literal Bible.Also read the definitions of the Translation Words and the Translation Notes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luke 10:8 and 9 in the Unlocked Dynamic Bible say: &ldquo;Whenever you enter a town and the people there welcome you, eat whatever food they provide for you. Heal the people there who are sick. Tell them, 'The kingdom of God is right here near you.&lsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Those same verses in the Unlocked Literal Bible say: &ldquo;Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you, and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.&lsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you notice the differences? There are some differences in the words each Bible version uses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you discover the meaning is the same? In both versions Jesus is giving specific instructions.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="identify-the-main-idea">Identify the Main Idea</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Then, after discovering the meaning of the passage, you should identify the main idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ask yourself, &ldquo;Why is the author writing this, and how does he feel about these things?
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at the Luke 10 passage again. Why do you think the author is writing this? What do you think the author feels about what he wrote? What do you think? After you have read the passage several times, answer these questions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    What is happening?
    <em>
     Jesus gave instructions.
    </em>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    When and where did these things take place?
    <em>
     To answer this question, you would need to remember what happened earlier. Earlier Luke writes that Jesus and the disciples are on the way to Jerusalem and chapter 10 starts with Jesus sending out 72 people to preach.
    </em>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Who is involved in this passage?
    <em>
     Jesus and the 72 people he sent out.
    </em>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Why were the 72 sent out?
    <em>
     To heal the sick and to tell everyone that the kingdom of God is near.
    </em>
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="the-message-of-the-writer">The Message of the Writer</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Finally, part of translating the source text accurately is to think of the original audience and the message of the writer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you think the author had specific things for the reader to know? Remember what we thought the author&rsquo;s main ideas were? The main ideas were:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The instructions that Jesus gave
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    That the 72 people whom Jesus sent out would have power to heal sick people
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    That they would tell others that the kingdom of God was near
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This is the message to the original audience. Allow the same message to come clearly into your mind in the target language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at the passage and think how you would retell it in your own language. Keep this initial translation by writing it down. Use an alphabet that suits your language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Remember:
  </strong>
  Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.

  Before you start this module have you learned about:

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="church-approved-translations">Church-Approved Translations</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The first three qualities of a good translation are
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#create-clear-translations" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_clear">
   clear
  </a>
  ,
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#create-natural-translations" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_natural">
   natural
  </a>
  , and
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#create-accurate-translations" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_accurate">
   accurate
  </a>
  . All three of these directly affect the words and phrases that are used in the translation. If a translation is not one of these three, simply changing or reordering the words that were used can often fix the problem. The fourth quality, church-approved, has less to do with the words used and more to do with the process that is used.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="the-goal-of-translation">The Goal of Translation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The goal of the translation of biblical content is not only to produce a high-quality translation, but to produce a high-quality translation that is used and loved by the church. High-quality translations must be clear, natural, and accurate. But for a translation to be used and loved by the church, it must be church-approved.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit4" id="how-to-create-a-church-approved-translation">How to Create a Church-Approved Translation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Creating a church-approved translation is all about the process of translation, checking, and distribution. The more church networks that are involved in these processes, the more likely they will approve of the translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not necessary that the church actively lead the translation and coordinate all the efforts, but it is necessary that whoever is leading the translation be approved by the church networks, preferably before they even start.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit5" id="church-approval-and-the-checking-levels">Church Approval and the Checking Levels</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The need for church-approval of a translation is clearly reflected in the Checking Levels. In fact, the Checking Levels are largely a measurement of how broadly the church approves of the translation.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Level 1 states that the church-approved translation team has approved the translation.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Level 2 states that the pastors and leaders of local churches approve the translation.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Level 3 states that leaders of multiple church networks approve of the translation.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  At each level, the people leading the translation should encourage participation and input from the church networks. By using this process, we hope to encourage church ownership of the translation among as many church networks as possible. With this approval, there should be nothing hindering the translation from being used to strengthen and encourage the church.

 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Read the whole passage through before you translate it. Understand the main point of the whole passage before you begin to translate it. If it is a narrative passage, such as a story of one of Jesus' miracles, picture the original situation. Imagine you were there. Imagine how people felt.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1 node">
   <div class="li">
    When translating the Bible, always use at least two versions of the Bible together as your source text. Comparing two versions will help you to think about the meaning, so that you do not just follow the words of one version literally. The two versions should be:
   </div>
   <ul>
    <li class="level3">
     <div class="li">
      One version that follows the form of the original language fairly closely, such as the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB).
     </div>
    </li>
    <li class="level3">
     <div class="li">
      One meaning-based version, such as the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).
     </div>

   </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use the Important Terms resources to learn about terms that you are not familiar with. Words sometimes have more than one meaning. Make sure that you have understood the right meaning of the word in the passage.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Also use the translationNotes that are with the ULB Bible. These are available in the translationStudio program and the Door43 website. These will explain things about the passage that may not be clear. If possible, also use other reference books, such as other versions of the Bible, a Bible dictionary, or Bible commentaries.

  Following is a list of ordered steps. The purpose of these steps is to help the translator produce a translation that is natural, understandable, and accurate. One of the most common translator mistakes is failing to use the natural forms in the target language for developing a coherent text. By following these steps, the translator will produce a more natural and more understandable translation.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Two of the major terms used in translating text are &ldquo;form&rdquo; and &ldquo;meaning.&rdquo; These terms are used in special ways in Bible translation. They have the following definitions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Form
    </strong>
    - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. &ldquo;Form&rdquo; refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Meaning
    </strong>
    - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="an-example">An Example</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Let's consider an example from normal life. Suppose a friend sent you the note below:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;I am having a very difficult week. My mother was sick and I spent all of my money to take her to the doctor and to buy medicine for her. I don't have anything left. My employer will not pay me until next weekend. I don't know how I am going to make it through the week. I don't even have money to buy food.&rdquo;
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
</div>
<h7 id="the-meaning">The Meaning</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Why do you think the friend sent this note? Just to tell you about his week? Probably not. His true intention was more likely to tell you:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;I need you to give me money.&rdquo;
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That is the primary
  <strong>
   meaning
  </strong>
  of the note that the sender wanted to communicate to you. However, it would be rude in some cultures to ask for money so directly&mdash;even from a friend. Therefore, he adjusted the
  <strong>
   form
  </strong>
  of the note to fill out the request and help you to understand his need. He wrote in a culturally-acceptable way that presented his need for money but did not obligate you to respond. He explained why he had no money (his sick mother), that his need was only temporary (until he is paid), and that his situation was desperate (no food). In other cultures, a more direct form of request might be more appropriate to communicate this meaning.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="the-form">The Form</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  In this example, the
  <strong>
   form
  </strong>
  is the entire text of the note. The
  <strong>
   meaning
  </strong>
  is &ldquo;I need you to give me money!&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  We use these terms in a similar way.
  <strong>
   Form
  </strong>
  will refer to the entire text of the verses that we are translating.
  <strong>
   Meaning
  </strong>
  will refer to the idea or ideas that the text is trying to communicate. The best form for communicating a certain meaning will be different in different languages and cultures.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="why-form-is-important">Why Form is Important</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The meaning of a text is the most crucial element. However, the form of the text is also very important. It is more than just a &ldquo;container&rdquo; for the meaning. It affects the way the meaning is understood and received. So the form itself also has a meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, look at the differences in form between these translations of Psalm 9:1-2:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart. I will tell of all the great things You have done. I will be glad and full of joy because of You. I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
   </em>
   \\(New Life Version)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart;
    <br/>
    I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
    <br/>
    I will be glad and exult in you;
    <br/>
    I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
   </em>
   \\(New Revised Standard Version)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The first version puts the text into a form that is no different than the form it uses for telling stories. Each line of the Psalm is stated as a separate sentence.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the second version, the text is arranged as lines of poetry are arranged in the target culture, with each line of the poem on a separate line of the page. Also, the first two lines are joined with a semi-colon, with the second line indented. These things indicate that they are related - they say very similar things. The third and fourth lines also have the same arrangement.
 </p>
 <p>
  A reader of the second version will know that this Psalm is a poem or a song because of the form that it has, while the reader of the first version may not get that understanding, because it was not communicated through the form of the text. The reader of the first version might be confused, because the Psalm seems to be a song, but it is not presented as one. The words are expressing a joyful emotion. As a translator, you should use the form for expressing a joyful song in your language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look also at the form of 2 Samuel 18:33b:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you&ndash;O Absalom, my son, my son!&rdquo;
   </em>
   (New International Version)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Someone might say that the meaning contained in this part of the verse is, &ldquo;I wish that I had died instead of my son Absalom.&rdquo; This does summarize the meaning contained in the words. But the form communicates much more than just that content. The repetition of &ldquo;my son&rdquo; so many times, the repetition of the name &ldquo;Absalom,&rdquo; the expression &ldquo;O,&rdquo; the wish form &ldquo;If only&hellip;&rdquo; all communicate a strong emotion of deep anguish on the part of a father who has lost a son. As a translator, you need to translate not just the meaning of the words, but also the meaning of the form. For 2 Samuel 18:33b, it is important that you use a form that communicates the same emotion as contained in the original language.
 </p>
 <p>
  So we need to examine the form of the biblical text and ask ourselves why it has that form and not some other one. What attitude or emotion is it communicating? Other questions that might help us to understand the meaning of the form are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Who wrote it?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Who received it?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    In what situation was it written?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Which words and phrases were chosen and why?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Are the words very emotional words, or is there anything special about the order of the words?
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When we understand the meaning of the form, then we can choose a form that has that same meaning in the target language and culture.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="culture-affects-meaning">Culture Affects Meaning</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The meaning of forms is determined by culture. The same form might have different meanings in different cultures. In translation, the meaning must remain the same, including the meaning of the form. This means that the form of the text must change to fit the culture. The form includes the language of the text, its arrangement, any repetitions, or any expressions that imitate sounds like &ldquo;O.&rdquo; You must examine all of these things, decide what they mean, and then decide which form will express that meaning in the best way for the target language and culture.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  A good translation requires that the meaning be the same in the target language as in the source language.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many different levels of meaning in the Bible. These levels include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Meaning of words
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">

 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    to grant a gift

  The translator must determine what each word means in the context, and then reproduce the same meaning in the translated text. These words then combine into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Therefore, the translator must also make sure that the words fit together into equivalent phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. so that the translated text has the same meaning on each level.

 <p>
  A literal translation is one that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes, or is hard to understand, as a result. An extreme version of a literal translation would not be a translation at all&mdash;it would have the same characters and words as the source language. The next closest step would be to replace each word in the source language with an equivalent word from the target language. Because of differences in grammar between languages, the target language audience would probably not understand this kind of translation. Some translators of the Bible wrongly believe that they should keep the word order of the source text in the target text and only substitute target language words for source language words. They wrongly believe that this shows respect for the source text as God's word. But in fact this kind of translation keeps people from understanding God's word. God wants people to understand his word, so it shows the greatest respect for the Bible and for God to translate the Bible so people can understand it.

  A word-for-word substitution is the most literal form of translation. It is not the best choice for doing good translations. A word-for-word translation simply substitutes an equivalent word in the target language for each word in the source language.

<h5 id="word-order">
 Word Order
</h5>
<div class="level5">
 <p>
  Here is an example of Luke 3:16 in the NET Bible. It says:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    John answered them all, &ldquo;I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That translation is clear and easy to understand. But suppose the translators had used the word-for-word method. What would the translation be like?
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, translated in English, are the words in the same order as the original Greek.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    answered  saying  to all  the  John  I  indeed  with water  baptize  you  he comes  but  who mightier than I of whom not I am worthy untie the strap of the sandals of him he you will baptize with spirit holy and fire
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This translation is awkward and can be hard to understand in English. How does it sound in your language?
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at the NET version above again. Notice the difference. The English NET translators did not keep the original Greek word order. They moved words around in the sentence to fit the rules of English grammar. They also changed some of the phrasing. For example, the English NET Bible said &ldquo;John answered them&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;John answered to all saying,&rdquo;  They used different words to make the text sound natural in English.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important that the final result communicates the same meaning as the Greek text.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this example the NET is a much better English translation than the awkward word-for-word version.
 </p>
</div>
<h5 id="range-of-word-meanings">
 Range of Word Meanings
</h5>
<div class="level5">
 <p>
  In addition, word-for-word substitution does not take into account that most individual words have a range of meanings. In word-for-word translations only one meaning is chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, the Greek word
  <em>
   aggelos
  </em>
  can refer to a human messenger or to an angel.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Luke 7:27, the word
  <em>
   aggelos
  </em>
  refers to a human messenger. Jesus was talking about John the Baptist when he said &ldquo;This is he of whom it is written, &lsquo;Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.&rsquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  In Luke 2:15, it refers to angels when it says &ldquo;when the angels went away from them into the sky.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  A word-for-word substitution might translate the Greek word in both verses as &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; or &ldquo;angel&rdquo; even though it is used to refer to two different kinds of beings. This would be confusing to the reader.
 </p>
</div>
<h5 id="figures-of-speech">
 Figures of Speech
</h5>
<div class="level5">
 <p>
  Finally, word-for-word substitution does not convey the meaning of a figure of speech.
 </p>
 <p>
  Figures of Speech have meanings that are different from the individual words that they are made up of. When they are translated word-for-word, their meanings are not clear. Even if they are translated so that they follow the normal word order of they language they are translated into, their meaning may not be clear. Please go to the Figures of Speech module to learn more on how to correctly translate them.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="the-meaning-of-forms-change">The meaning of forms change</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Literal translations keep the form of the source text in the target text. Some translators might want to do this because, as we saw in the teaching module &ldquo;The Importance of Form,&rdquo; the form of a text affects the meaning of the text. However, we must keep in mind that people from different cultures understand the meaning of forms differently. In different cultures, the same form may be understood in very different ways. Therefore it is not possible to protect the meaning from change by keeping the original forms. The only way to protect the meaning is to change the original form to a new form that communicates the same meaning in the new culture as the old form did in the old culture.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="different-languages-use-different-orders-of-words-and-phrases">Different languages use different orders of words and phrases</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  If you keep the source word order in  your translation, it will be very difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the people who speak your language to understand it. You must use the natural word order of the target language so that people can understand the meaning of the text.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit4" id="different-languages-use-different-idioms-and-expressions">Different languages use different idioms and expressions</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Each language has its own idioms and other expressions, such as words that represent sounds or emotions. In order to express the meaning of these things, you must choose an idiom or expression that has that same meaning in the target language, not just translate each word. If you do that, the idiom or expression will have the wrong meaning.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit5" id="some-terms-do-not-have-equivalents-in-other-cultures">Some terms do not have equivalents in other cultures</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The Bible contains many terms for things that no longer exist, such as ancient weights (stadia, cubit), money (denarius, stater) and measures (hin, ephah). Animals in Scripture may not exist in some parts of the world (fox, camel). Other words may be unknown in some cultures (snow, circumcision). It is not possible to simply substitute equivalent words for these terms in those situations. The translator must find another way to communicate the original meaning.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit6" id="the-bible-was-intended-to-be-understood">The Bible was intended to be understood</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The testimony of the Scriptures themselves shows that they were meant to be understood. The Bible is written in three languages because the language of the people changed. When the Jews returned from exile and no longer remembered Hebrew, the priests translated the Old Testament readings into Aramaic so they could understand (Neh 8:8). Later, when the New Testament was written, it was written in the common Koine Greek, which was the language that most people spoke at that time, rather than Hebrew or Aramaic or even classical Greek, which would have been harder for common people to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  These and other reasons demonstrate that God wants people to understand his word. So we know that he wants us to translate the meaning of the Bible, not reproduce the form. The meaning of the Scriptures is more important than the form.

 <p>
  We have looked closely at literal translations. Now, we will look at meaning-based translations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meaning-based translations are also called:

 </ul>

<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="key-characteristic">Key Characteristic</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The key characteristic of meaning-based translations is that they give priority to translating the meaning over reproducing the form of the source text. That is, they
  <strong>
   change the form of the text as needed in order to make the meaning clear.
  </strong>
  The most common types of changes that meaning-based translations make are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    change word order to match the grammar of the target language
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">

  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    substitute or explain idioms
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    explain or translate terms from other languages (ex: &ldquo;Golgotha&rdquo; = &ldquo;place of the skull&rdquo;)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    use phrases with simpler words instead of trying to find single word equivalents for difficult or uncommon words in the source text
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    replace terms that are unknown in the target culture with equivalent terms or descriptions
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    replace connecting words that the target language does not use with connecting words that the target language needs
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit4" id="examples-of-meaning-based-translations">Examples of Meaning-Based Translations</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  What does a meaning-based translation look like? We will look at how different versions translate the same verse.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Luke 3:8,
  <em>
   John the Baptist rebukes the self-righteous people who came to be baptized.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Greek
  </strong>
  text of the first half of the verse is shown below.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   &Pi;&omicron;&iota;ή&sigma;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon; &omicron;ὖ&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&rho;&pi;&omicron;ὺ&sigmaf; ἀ&xi;ί&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &tau;ῆ&sigmaf; &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;ί&alpha;&sigmaf;
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   English
  </strong>
  translation in the same order as each Greek word, with some alternative English words to choose from, is below.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    Do/make/produce therefore fruits fit/appropriate of the repentance
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
</div>
<h7 id="literal">Literal</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  A literal translation would usually follow the words and order of the Greek text as closely as possible, such as the following.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, &hellip;
   </em>
   (NASB)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Note that this fairly-literal translation retains the words &ldquo;fruits&rdquo; and &ldquo;repentance.&rdquo; The word order is also very similar to the Greek text.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="meaning-based">Meaning-Based</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Meaning-based translations, on the other hand, are more likely to change the words and order if the translators think it will help to clarify the meaning. Consider these two meaning-based translations:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &hellip;prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds.
   </em>
   -Living Bible (LB)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.
   </em>
   -New Living Translation (NLT)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Notice that both of these translations have changed the word order to be more natural in English. Also, the word &ldquo;fruits&rdquo; no longer appears. In fact, the LB translation does not use any of the words in the NASB translation. Instead, rather than &ldquo;fruits,&rdquo; the meaning-based translations refer to &ldquo;deeds&rdquo; or to &ldquo;the way you live.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fruits&rdquo; in this verse is used as part of a metaphor. The meaning of &ldquo;fruits&rdquo; in this metaphor is &ldquo;the things that a person does.&rdquo; (See the teaching module on Metaphor.) So these translations translated the meaning in context, rather than just the word. They also used more understandable phrases such as, &ldquo;turned from sin&rdquo; rather than the single difficult word, &ldquo;repentance,&rdquo; or they explained the word by saying, &ldquo;repented of your sins and turned to God.&rdquo;  The meaning in all of them is the same, but the form is very different. In the meaning-based translations, the meaning is much clearer.

  The people who wrote the Bible had messages from God that God wanted people to understand. These original writers used whatever language that they and their people spoke at the time when God gave his message so that they and their people could understand God's messages. God wants people today to understand those same messages. But people today do not speak those languages that the Bible was written in long ago. So God has given us the task of translating the Bible into the languages that people speak today.
 </p>
 <p>
  From this we can see that the particular language that people use to communicate God's messages is not important. The particular words that are used is not important. What is important is the meaning that those words communicate. The meaning is the message, not the words or the language. What we must translate, then, is not the words or the forms of the sentences of the  source languages, but the meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at the pairs of sentences below.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    It rained all night.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Rain fell all night.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    John was very surprised when he heard the news.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The news very much amazed John when he heard it.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    It was a hot day.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The day was hot.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Peter&rsquo;s house
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The house that belongs to Peter
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  You can see that the meaning of each pair of sentences is the same, even though they use different words. This is the way it is in a good translation. We will use different words than the source text, but we will keep the meaning the same. We will use words that our people understand and use them in a way that is natural for our language. Communicating the same meaning as the source text in a clear and natural way is the goal of translation.

  Translating the Bible is a very large and difficult task that will take many people to accomplish. This module will discuss the skills that will be needed by members of the Bible translation team, and the responsibilities that these people will have.

  As well as making the first drafts, these people will form the core of the translation team that will check each other's work, check the translation with the language community, and receive the suggestions for revision from the level 2 and level 3 checkers. After each review or checking session, these translators are responsible to make the changes to the translation that are necessary so that it communicates what it should in the best way. So they will revise the translation many, many times.

 <p>
  If the translators themselves are not inputting the translation draft into a computer or tablet, then someone else on the team needs to do this. This needs to be someone who can type without making a lot of errors. This person also needs to know how to use punctuation marks correctly and consistently. This person may also need to type the revisions and corrections to the translation after each round of checking.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="translation-testers">Translation Testers</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Some people need to test the translation with members of the language community to make sure that the translation is clear and sounds natural in the target language. Usually these are the translators, but they could be other people. These testers need to read the translation to people and then ask them questions to see how they are understanding it. For a description of this task, see
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#language-community-check" title="en:ta:vol1:checking:language_community_check">
   Language Community Check
  </a>
  . For alternate methods of testing the translation, see

  </a>

</div>
<h7 id="checkers">Checkers</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  The people who are selected to check the translation for accuracy should be people who already know the Bible well in the source language. They should be able to read well in the source language. They will be comparing the translation to the source Bible, to make sure that the translation communicates everything that is in the source Bible. They should be people who are interested in the translation work and who have time to do a good job of checking. It is good if these people can include members of the different church groups who speak the target language and who will use the translation. The level 2 checkers should be leaders in their local church. The level 3 checkers should be leaders of groups of churches, or respected very widely in the language area. Since many of these people are very busy, it may work best to send different books or chapters to different people, and not burden one or two people with the whole translation.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="why-is-it-important">Why Is It Important?</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  When choosing a source text from which to do a translation, considering the copyright/licensing issue is important for two reasons. First, if you translate from a copyrighted work without prior permission you are breaking the law because translation is a right reserved for the owner of the content. In some places, copyright infringement is a criminal offense and may be prosecuted by the government without the copyright holder's consent! Second, when a translation is done off of a copyrighted work, the translation is the intellectual property of the copyright holder of the source text. They maintain all the rights of the translation just as they do with the source text. For these and other reasons, unfoldingWord will only distribute translations that are not in violation of copyright law.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Especially in an open project like unfoldingWord, it is important to keep track of published versions. It is important because translations (and source texts) can change frequently. Being able to identify each version helps bring clarity about which iteration is being talked about. Version numbers are also important because all translations should be based off of the latest source text. If the source text changes, the translation should be updated to match the latest version.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before starting a translation project, please ensure that you have the latest version of the source text.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="how-versioning-works">How Versioning Works</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Version numbers are only given when a work is published, not when they are edited (in Door43 or translationStudio). Edit revision is kept in Door43, but this is different than a work being given a version number.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prior to August 1, 2015, the versioning system used by unfoldingWord was very complex. Each major revision would increase the version number by 0.1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 1.1) while each minor revision would change it by 0.0.1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 1.0.1). When translations were created based off of a version number, it became widely complex to keep track of what translation was based off of which version.
 </p>
 <p>
  On August 1, 2015, a new versioning system was adopted. Each source text was given an integer (e.g. ver 1). Any edits made to the source text increased the integer by 1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 2). Any translations based off of that source text took the version number the translation was based off of and added .1 (e.g. a translation off of ver 2 would be published as ver 2.1). A translation off of that translation would add a .1 to the version number it was created from (e.g. a translation off of ver 2.1 would be published as 2.1.1). Any time a text was updated, the number associated with that text would increase by 1 (e.g. if ver 2.1.1 was updated, it would become ver 2.1.2; ver 2.1 would become ver 2.2; etc).

  Many translations have the version number listed. If the version number is not available, figuring out which version a translation was based off of is important.
 </p>
 <p>
  To figure out which version a particular translation was translated from, do the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Check story #45. If it ends with Philip looking at the chariot, then it is translated from version 1.x. If it ends with the Ethiopian Official smiling, go to the next step.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Check frame 06-02. If the phrase &ldquo;to the land where Abraham's relatives lived&rdquo; is not included, then it is translated from version 2.x. If it is included, it is translated from at least version 3.x. (Also check frame 09-06. If &ldquo;in order to save him from being killed&rdquo; is not included, it is translated from version 2.x. If it is included, it is translated from at least version 3.x.)

 <p>
  The original language is the language in which a Bible text was initially written. The original language of the New Testament is Greek. The original language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the original language of some parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The original language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The source Language is the language from which the translation is being made. If a translator is translating the Bible from the original languages, then the original language and the source language for his translation are the same. However, only people who have spent many years studying the original languages understand them and can use them as a source language. For that reason, most translators use Bibles that have been translated into a language of wider communication as their source language text.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are translating from a language of wider communication, it is a good idea to have someone who has studied the original languages compare the meaning in the target language translation with the meaning in the original language to make sure that the meaning is the same. Another way to make sure that the meaning of the target language translation is accurate is to check the translation with translation helps that have been written by people who know the original languages. These would include Bible commentaries and dictionaries, as well as the unfoldingWord Translation Notes, Important Terms definitions, and Translation Questions with their answers.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="source-language-may-not-be-accurate">Source Language may not be Accurate</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  If the translator does not understand the original language, he will have to use a language of wider communication as a source language. The meaning in the source may be correct, depending on how carefully it was translated from the original. But it is still a translation, so it is a step away from the original and is not quite the same. In some cases, the source may have actually been translated from another source, rather than from the original, putting it two steps away from the original.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider the example below. A translator uses a Swahili New Testament as the source for a new target language translation. However, the particular Swahili Bible version he is using was actually translated from English &mdash; not directly from the Greek (the original language). So it is possible that some of the meaning has changed in the chain of translation from the original to the target languages.

<p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The only way to make sure the translation is as accurate as possible is to compare the new translation with the original languages. Where this is not possible, use the ULB and UDB as source texts, along with other Bible translations that were translated from the original languages.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The Bible was written many hundreds of years ago as God inspired his prophets and apostles in ancient times. The Old Testament books were written in Hebrew, with a few parts in Aramaic, the language that the people of Israel used as they lived in exile in Assyria and Babylon. The New Testament books were written in Greek, the language that was used for wider communication throughout the known world between 300 years before Christ and 300 years after Christ. The Old Testament was also translated into Greek about two to three hundred years before Christ.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since there was no paper in those early days, these writings were put on specially prepared animal skins or a material woven of reeds. These writings were extremely important, so trained people copied them over and over by hand, with great care to be accurate and faithful to the original text that they were copying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over hundreds of years, people made very many copies of the Bible and these copies became spread throughout the ancient world. As the Bible was translated into other ancient languages such as Latin, the translators in various parts of the world used the copies that were available to them when they translated. Later, people began to collect these copies and compare them. While these copies were very much the same, some of them had small differences from each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  To decide which copies were right at these places where there were small differences, Bible scholars decided that the oldest copies were better because they were closer to the originals. Where the more recent copies were different, the Bible scholars decided that these differences were either accidental errors made while copying or sometimes they were ideas put into the copies by people who were not copying in a strictly faithful manner. So, when we try to decide which copies are more reliable or trustworthy, we prefer the older ones and also we prefer the groups of copies that were made by people who followed a tradition that had a reputation for accuracy and faithfulness.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="explanation">Explanation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Some people who were making copies of Bible books added words or even whole sentences into the text that they copied. Sometimes this was to explain what was in the text and sometimes it was to add to the ideas in the text, often using phrases from other places in the Bible. Sometimes this happened accidentally, as the person copied something twice or included in the text a comment that someone else had written beside the text. Sometimes words were left out by accident, as well. But over all, the Bible books have been copied with great accuracy and faithfulness over many, many years. By comparing many different copies with each other, Bible scholars can decide which copies are accurate and which ones have errors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes there will be a footnote with the ULB that says something like, &ldquo;some ancient authorities add a verse here.&rdquo; We recommend that the translator include this footnote when translating the passages where it appears in the ULB. For example, there will be a note like this at Mark 16:9-20 and at verses such as Acts 8:37 and 1 John 5:7-8. This means that some copies of the Bible have these verses, but others that are older and considered to be accurate do not.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bible student needs to be careful to look at the history of the added words and what Bible scholars say about them in order to determine whether they are likely to be from the original text. This requires a great deal of study.
 </p>

 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Translators have a choice about which manuscripts to follow. They can translate as the ULB does, or if they prefer other Bibles that follow other manuscripts, they may follow them.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If translators follow the ULB, translating the verses that are there and not translating verses that are not in the ULB, they should also translate the footnotes that the ULB provides in those places.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If translators follow other manuscripts (for example, if they translate Acts 8:37 as part of their main text although the ULB does not include that verse), they may need to write their footnote differently, for example, &ldquo;Some ancient authorities omit verse 37.&rdquo;

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="creating-an-alphabet">Creating an Alphabet</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  If your language has not been written down before, then you will need to create an alphabet so that you can write it. There are many things to think about when creating an alphabet, and creating a good one can be very difficult. If this seems to be too difficult, you could do an audio translation instead of a written one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of a good alphabet is to have one letter to represent each different sound of your language.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a neighboring language already has an alphabet, and if that language has similar sounds to your language, it might work well to simply borrow their alphabet. If not, then the next best thing is to borrow the alphabet from the national language that you learned in school. However, it is likely that your language has sounds that the national language does not, and so it will be difficult to use this alphabet to represent all of the sounds of your language. In that case, it is good to think about each sound in your language. Write out the national language alphabet on a piece of paper from top to bottom. Then write a word from your language next to each letter that either starts with that sound or has that sound in it. Underline the letter that makes that sound in each of the words. There may be letters in the national alphabet that your language does not use. That is fine. Now think about the sounds from these words that you had a hard time writing, or that you could not find a letter for. If the sound is similar to a sound that you did find a letter for, then maybe you can modify that letter to represent the other sound. For example, if you have a sound represented by &ldquo;s&rdquo;, and a similar sound that there was no letter for, you could add a mark to the letter for the similar sound, such as putting ' or ^ or ~ on top of it. If you find that there is a group of sounds that seem to all have the same kind of difference from the national language sounds, then it is good to modify that group of letters in the same way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have finished this exercise and cannot think of any more sounds in your language, try writing a story or write down something that happened recently. As you write, you will probably discover sounds that you had not thought of earlier. Continue to modify letters so that you can write these sounds. Add these sounds to the list you made earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Take your list of sounds to other speakers of your language who also read the national language and see what they think about it. Maybe they can suggest a different way to modify some letters that is simpler or easier to read. Also show these other people the story you wrote and teach them to read it by referring to your list of words and letter-sounds. If they can learn to read it easily, then your alphabet is good. If it is difficult, then there might be parts of the alphabet that still need work to be simpler, or there may be different sounds that are being represented by the same letter, or there may be some sounds that you still need to find letters for.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is good to continue to work on this alphabet together with other speakers of your language who are good readers in the national language. You can discuss the different sounds and decide on the best way to represent them together.

 <p>
  These questions will give the wider community an understanding of some of the preliminary decisions made by the translator for writing the local language in the areas of punctuation, spelling and the writing of names in the Bible.

 <p>
  You can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found
  <a class="wikilink1" href="/en/obs/31" title="en:obs:31">
   Story #31
  </a>
  is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing Open Bible Stories, we encourage the translation team to start translating the Bible. We highly recommend starting with books that are largely narrative (like Ruth or the Gospel of Mark) and saving the more difficult, theologically &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; books (like Romans and Galatians) until much later in the translation process.

  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If you are translating Open Bible Stories, read the entire story before starting to translate it. If you are translating the Bible, read the entire chapter before you start to translate any part of it. This way you will understand how the part you are translating fits into the larger context, and you will translate it better.

  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Read the passage that you plan to translate in as many different translations as you have. The ULB will help you to see the form of the original text, and the UDB will help you to understand the meaning of the original text. Think about how to communicate the meaning in the form that people would use in your language. Also read any Bible helps or commentaries that you have that talk about that passage.

    Discuss the passage, the Translation Notes, and the important terms with others in the translation team.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    When you understand well what the passage is saying, write down (or record) what it is saying in your language, in the way that someone from your language community would say it. Write down (or record) the whole passage (the chunk of text) without looking at the source text. This will help you to say these things in a way that is natural for your language, rather than in a way that was natural for the source language but that is not the best way to say it in your language.

 <p>
  Translation Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain some of the Bible background that the translator needs to know to translate Open Bible Stories, as well as inform translators about different ways that they might express the same meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Translation Words are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible that are important to translate correctly. Each of these important terms has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places where that term is used in either Open Bible Stories or the Bible. This is to show the translator other ways that the important term is used and to ensure that it has been translated correctly in those places, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have consulted the Translation Notes and Translation Words, then you are ready to make the best translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Please use the Translation Notes &amp; Translation Words when doing your translation!

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="translation-notes">Translation Notes</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Translation Notes are words or phrases copied from the ULB and then explained. In English, the ULB text is in bold.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many different type of notes in the Translation Notes. You should read all of the Translation Notes for a frame or chunk of text before starting to translate it. You should also read both the ULB and the UDB and the definitions of the translationWords.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="types-of-notes1">Types of Notes</h6>
<div class="level3">
</div>
<h7 id="definitions">Definitions</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  One type of Translation Note is the definition of a word. If a word in the ULB seems special or unusual, but not important enough to be included in the Translation Words, the Translation Notes will have the meaning of the word. Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence  format. Here are examples:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     marketplace
    </strong>
    - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     flute
    </strong>
    - a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     kings' palaces
    </strong>
    - a large, expensive house that a king lives in
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="explanations">Explanations</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Simple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format. For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     washing their nets
    </strong>
    - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     motioned
    </strong>
    - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="suggested-translations">Suggested Translations</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Another type of Translation Note is to give you suggestions for different ways you could translate the same meaning. There are several types of suggested translations.
 </p>
</div>
<h5 id="direct-replacements">
 Direct Replacements
</h5>
<div class="level5">
 <p>
  Synonyms or equivalent phrases are written in double-quotes. These can replace the text in the ULB.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this example, the words &ldquo;the path&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;the road&rdquo; can  replace the words &ldquo;the way&rdquo; in the ULB. You can then decide if it is more natural to use a word like &ldquo;path&rdquo; or &ldquo;road&rdquo; or &ldquo;way&rdquo; in your language.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     the way
    </strong>
    - &ldquo;the path&rdquo; or &ldquo;the road&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In this example, the words &ldquo;do the same thing&rdquo; can replace the words &ldquo;do  likewise&rdquo; in the ULB. You, as the translator, can decide which is more  natural for your language.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     do likewise
    </strong>
    - &ldquo;do the same thing.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h5 id="alternate-translation-s">
 Alternate Translation(s)
</h5>
<div class="level5">
 <p>
  An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language may use a different form to communicate the same meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Examples include adding implicit information, changing passive voice to active, and stating rhetorical questions as statements.
 </p>
 <p>
  The letters &ldquo;AT&rdquo; stand for &ldquo;Alternate Translation,&rdquo; so &ldquo;AT:&rdquo; indicates that what follows is an alternate translation that should only be used when the form or content of the ULB is confusing or is not enough to communicate the meaning in your language.  Some examples are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     see the salvation of God
    </strong>
    - AT: &ldquo;learn about how God saves people from sin.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Follow me
    </strong>
    - AT: &ldquo;Be my disciple&rdquo; or &ldquo;Come, follow me as your teacher.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="clarifying-translation-in-the-udb">Clarifying Translation in the UDB</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  There may be no note if the UDB provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion there may text from the UDB as well as a suggested translation. In that case, there will be &ldquo;(UDB)&rdquo; after the text from the UDB as below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     implored him
    </strong>
    - &ldquo;begged him&rdquo; or &ldquo;pleaded with him&rdquo; (UDB)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     he fell on his face
    </strong>
    - &ldquo;he bowed down to the ground&rdquo; (UDB) or &ldquo;he knelt and touched the ground with his face&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="alternate-meaning-s">Alternate Meaning(s)</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  The Translation Notes will give
  <strong>
   alternate meanings
  </strong>
  when there are different ways to understand what a word or phrase means.
 </p>
 <p>
  This kind of note will start with the words, &ldquo;Possible meanings  are that,&rdquo; and then it will number the possible meanings with the preferred or most likely meaning first. If the meaning is given as an explanation, like the following examples, it is not in quotes.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     You are like a young lion &hellip; like a monster in the seas
    </strong>
    - Possible meanings are that 1) he was like a lion and a monster or 2) he thought he was like a lion, but he was really only a monster.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     like a monster in the seas
    </strong>
    - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation, like the following examples, it is in quotes.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     fell down at Jesus knees
    </strong>
    - Possible meanings are 1) &ldquo;bowed down at Jesus feet&rdquo; or 2) &ldquo;lay down  on the ground at Jesus feet&rdquo; or 3) &ldquo;knelt down before Jesus.&rdquo; Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for  Jesus.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h7 id="identify-figures-of-speech">Identify Figures of Speech</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  The purpose of some Translation Notes is to alert you to figures of speech in the ULB and to give ideas for how to translate the same meaning in a different way. Notes that identify and explain a figure of speech will use sentence form and put the meaning in quotes.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Make ready the way of the Lord
    </strong>
    - This phrase compares people preparing themselves for the arrival of the Lord to people who are repairing a road for someone to use it. AT: &ldquo;Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes.&rdquo; (See: Metaphor)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     You offspring of poisonous snakes
    </strong>
    - Jesus uses this expression to emphasize how dangerous the Pharisees are. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: &ldquo;You evil poisonous snakes!&rdquo; or &ldquo;You are evil like poisonous snakes.&rdquo; (See: Metaphor)
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If there is a Translation Academy page that explains a certain kind of figure of speech, the note will identify what kind of figure of speech it is in parentheses at the end of the note. For example, (See: Metaphor). You can then look up that kind of figure of speech in Translation Academy for more explanation.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="indirect-to-direct-quote">Indirect to Direct Quote</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  When a Translation Note is giving a direct quote as an alternative translation for an indirect quote, it will say, &ldquo;This can be translated as a direct quote:&rdquo; and then it will give a suggestion for how to translate it as a direct quote. For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     to tell no one
    </strong>
    -  This can be translated as a direct quote: &ldquo;Do not tell anyone.&rdquo; The  implied information is &ldquo;that you have been healed.&rdquo; (See: Speech Quotations, Explicit and Implicit Information)
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Whenever a Translation Note says &ldquo;See:&rdquo; in parentheses at the end of the note, the words that follow are topics that you can look up in Translation Academy that will further explain the issue that the Note talks about.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="multiple-notes-on-long-phrase">Multiple Notes on Long Phrase</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and also separate notes for portions of that same phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts come afterward. For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man
    </strong>
    - This can be translated as an indirect quote: &ldquo;you say that he is a  gluttonous man&rdquo; or &ldquo;you accuse him of being a gluttonous man.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">

  Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in one book. When this happens, there will be a link in the Notes - green chapter and verse numbers that you can click on - that will take you back to where you have translated that phrase before. This will make it easier for you to translate this phrase by reminding you of where you have already translated it. This will make your translation faster and more consistent because you will be reminded to translate that phrase in the same way each time. If a translation that you have used before for the same phrase does not fit a new context, then you will have to think of a new way to translate it. In this case, you should make a note of it and discuss it with others on the translation team. These links will only take you back to notes in the book that you are working on.

  <br/>
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="how-to-translate-unknowns">How to Translate Unknowns</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  There are times that the source language will use words and ideas that are not familiar. If you do not know what the source word means, the Translation Notes and Important Terms pages will help you understand its meaning. Sometimes, however, a word in the source text is an object, animal, practice, or other thing that is not known to the people who speak the target language. The following information will help with translating these unknown things or concepts.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="historical-facts">Historical facts</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  It is very important to remember that if the term expresses a historical fact, then that fact must be kept in a translation. For example, in Mark 11:13, Jesus cursed a fig tree. To substitute any other kind of tree would be untrue to a historical fact. To translate this, follow one of the following options:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a general descriptive phrase, such as &ldquo;a fruit tree.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a descriptive phrase with a borrowed word, such as &ldquo;a tree that bears fruit called 'figs.'&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a borrowed word for the name of the tree: &ldquo;a fig tree.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  For the last two choices, a footnote would be necessary to explain what &ldquo;fig&rdquo; means.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another example is In John 12:14-15 where it says that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey's colt, which fulfilled a prophecy in the the Old Testament. Since it says that Jesus was sitting on a donkey's colt, which is a young donkey, the translation should not say that he sat on an ox, for example. If the word for &ldquo;donkey&rdquo; does not exist in the target language, a borrowed word could be used and explained in the text or in a footnote. For example, the text could say, &ldquo;riding on the young of a kind of work animal called a &lsquo;donkey.'&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  This is different from the use of an animal as part of a teaching or illustration. In that case, it is not a matter of historical fact. See the example of &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; below.

<h7 id="animals">Animals</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  An example of the use of an animal in the Bible as an illustration is in John 10:12 where the word &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; is used as a way to describe a person who is harmful to God's people. There are many things to describe about a wolf but what is important in this verse is that it is a fierce and dangerous animal that frightens and harms the sheep.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a wolf is an unknown animal in your culture, you could substitute an animal that looks similar and that has similar characteristics. For example, large wild dogs are similar to wolves. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. So &ldquo;wolves&rdquo; could be translated with a generic term like &ldquo;wild dogs&rdquo; or &ldquo;fierce dogs&rdquo; or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as &ldquo;coyotes&rdquo; or &ldquo;jackals.&rdquo; You could also use a general descriptive phrase such as, &ldquo;a dangerous wild animal&rdquo; that focuses on the characteristics that are being highlighted in the text.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also see the Translation Note at Luke 10:3 for other translation suggestions for
  <a class="wikilink1" href="/en/bible/notes/luk/10/03" title="en:bible:notes:luk:10:03">
   "wolf."
  </a>
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="cultural-practices">Cultural practices</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  There might be many differences between the biblical culture and the target language culture. Sometimes a cultural substitute can be used. But be careful not to change any historical facts (see explanation above).
 </p>
 <p>
  The unknown biblical practice could be explained in a footnote or Bible teaching. The explanations could include a known cultural practice that has the same meaning as the one described in the Bible text. For example, in Jewish culture, grief and repentance for sin were shown by wearing a rough type of cloth (sackcloth) and putting ashes on the head. Wailing was another sign of grief. In other cultures grief may be shown in different ways. But if this practice was something that actually happened it needs to be recorded as such, with an explanation that tells what it means, perhaps using a practice from the target culture that has the same meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, in certain cultures when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. This can be translated as &ldquo;to greet him with a kiss&rdquo; or &ldquo;to greet him by kissing him.&rdquo; If this is not done in your culture, you could explain it with a footnote. If your readers would find it embarrassing or inappropriate to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way such as, &ldquo;to give him a friendly greeting.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  See the example of
  <a class="wikilink1" href="/en/bible/notes/luk/22/47" title="en:bible:notes:luk:22:47">
   'greet with a kiss'
  </a>
  in Luke 22:47.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit4" id="translation-suggestions">Translation Suggestions</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Here are suggestions to keep in mind when translating a term that is not familiar in your language:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a descriptive phrase. You will most likely need to use a phrase to explain the meaning of the unknown word. It is important only to describe the part of the meaning which is being used in the particular verse being translated.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Substitute something similar. At times the exact word may be unknown to the people of the target language but there might be something similar that could be used in its place. Only do this if the term does not express a historical fact.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a foreign word from another language. Foreign words are words taken from a language that is not the target language. You could also use the foreign word together with a general word or descriptive phrase.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a word that is more general in meaning. An example would be &ldquo;work animal&rdquo; which is more general than the word &ldquo;donkey.&rdquo; This is acceptable because a donkey is a kind of work animal.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning. Sometimes there is no general word in the target language to describe the term, therefore you can give specific examples of the term being referred to. An example would be if there is no word for &ldquo;lights&rdquo; to refer to heavenly bodies, you could possibly say, &ldquo;the sun, the moon, and the stars,&rdquo; using specific words.

  A Proper Name (or Proper Noun) is a specific name for someone or something. In contrast, the word &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; is a common name&ndash;it is a general term describing a kind of landform. Mount Zion is a specific mountain in Israel; therefore, it is a Proper Name. Understanding this difference will help you as you watch the video (see link below). Within the Bible you will hear many proper names which might be unknown to the reader. It could be unclear what the name is referring to. A Proper Name could refer to a person, a country, a certain landform, a body of water, or something else. In this video you will learn how to identify what kind of thing a particular proper name is referring to.

 <p>
  There are many things to keep in mind when translating a name in the Bible:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Proper names sometimes reveal information about the person, place, or thing it refers to.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Proper names of people may reveal something about the origin or history of the family.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Proper names of people may reveal something about a characteristic of the person.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Sometimes people and places have more than one name.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These are the different ways to translate names in the Bible. Discuss these with the translation team, and choose one:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Copy the proper name from the source language into the target language with no change. Often, this means using the name as it is spelled in the national language translation.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use the name from the source language, but make adjustments to the spelling or add whatever is necessary so that it sounds like the right kind of name in the target language.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language, and using the target language's spelling system, write the name in a way that people will read it with the source language's pronunciation.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Translate the meaning of the name.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If a person or place has two names, follow one of these two ways. In either case, it may be necessary to add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>

 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The word &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; describes a person. So &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; tells us that Theophilus is the name of a person.

 <p>
  The word &ldquo;Mount&rdquo; next to &ldquo;Zion&rdquo; lets us know that it refers to a mountain landform named &ldquo;Zion&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mount Zion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; is the name of a city. We know it is a place because it is where someone lives, and this verse also tells us that Jerusalem is located on Mount Zion.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="definition">Definition</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Figures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of the figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of the words. In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize figures of speech and know what the figure of speech means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language.

 <p>
  A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words &lsquo;like&rsquo; and &lsquo;as&rsquo; are not used to show it. (See
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#simile" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile">
   Simile
  </a>
  .). A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, &ldquo;Life is a journey,&rdquo; is a metaphor that helps convey a concept about life - that it is like a journey in some way - perhaps because in both you are always moving along and progressing, not staying in the same place. In this example, &ldquo;life&rdquo; is the topic, &ldquo;a journey&rdquo; is the image that is being applied to the topic, and the concept of movement or progression is the point of similarity. Every metaphor has a topic, an image, and a point of similarity. But as with this example, usually the point of similarity is not stated. Often the author expects the reader or hearer to think about the comparison and see the point of similarity for themselves.

    Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.

    If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use an image from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity clearly. However, do not do this if it was also not clear to the original audience.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If the topic is not stated clearly in the original and it would be unclear to your readers what the topic is, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples &ldquo;Beware of the
    <em class="u">
     yeast
    </em>
    of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&rdquo; His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the
    <em class="u">
     teaching
    </em>
    of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, &ldquo;The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast.&rdquo; the point of similarity is that they both spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;as&rdquo;.

   Jesus said to them. &ldquo;I am the

   </em>
   . He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty.&ldquo; John 6:35
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Jesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">

   <em class="u">
    shadow of death
   </em>
   .  Luke 1:78b-79a
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.

 <p>
  Because he knows the meanings of so many words, he is compared to a dictionary. Dictionaries contain the meanings of many words.

 <p>
  In this simile, Jesus compared the protection he wanted to give the people of Jerusalem to the kind of protection a hen gives to her chicks when they are in danger. It's not that he would literally gather the people underneath him, but he would protect them and they would trust him.

 <p>
  Jesus did not say how his coming back to earth would be like when lightning flashes. But we can understand from the rest of the text that just as lighting flashes suddenly and everyone can see it, he will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.

  A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not expected for rhetorical questions. A rhetorical question may be used to express deep emotion or to encourage the reader to think deeply on a topic. At times, rhetorical questions are used for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding. Some languages have other purposes as well.

    Determine the purpose of the rhetorical question.
   </div>

  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If your language would use a rhetorical question for that purpose, then use it.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Languages may have different forms of rhetorical questions for different purposes. For example, if a parent wants to scold or rebuke his child for writing on the walls, some languages could do it with different forms of rhetorical questions, such as: &ldquo;Why are you writing on the wall?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who told you to write on the wall?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is that
    <em class="u">
     your
    </em>
    wall that you are writing on?&rdquo; Other languages would use a statement, such as: &ldquo;I told you not to write on the walls,&rdquo; or a command, such as: &ldquo;Do not write on the walls!&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If, after determining the purpose of the rhetorical question, your decide that your language would use a statement or a command for that purpose, then use a statement or command instead of a rhetorical question. For example, in Mark 13:2, Jesus says to one of his disciples, &ldquo;Do you see these great buildings?&rdquo; (ULB). Jesus knows that the disciple sees them, but he uses a rhetorical question to draw attention to them. If your language would not use a rhetorical question to draw people's attention to something, then use whatever form is natural, such as a command, &ldquo;Look at these great buildings,&rdquo; or a statement, &ldquo;These buildings are very great.&rdquo;

 <p>
  Irony is using words that appear to say the opposite of what you mean. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on how different something is from what it should be, or how far someone's belief is from the truth. Irony makes these points more powerfully than direct statements do. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.

    If the irony would be understood correctly, translate it as is.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    If the irony would not be understood correctly, you could indicate that the thoughts are not truly those of the speaker but of someone else. For example,  In Mark 7:9, Jesus says to the Pharisees, &ldquo;Rightly you set aside the commandment of God in order to set up your own tradition.&rdquo; Jesus is putting into words what the Pharisees actually do, even though they would never admit that they do this. Everyone who hears this, including Jesus, knows that it is wrong to set aside a commandment of God. So Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees in a powerful way by using words that seem to commend them for doing wrong. If the irony would not be understood, this could be translated as &ldquo;You think you have done well in following your traditions. But as you do that, you have rejected God's commandments.&rdquo;

 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, &ldquo;Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?&rdquo; -Luke 22:64b (WEB)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The soldiers were hitting Jesus and they told him to prophecy and say who hit him. This was irony. They were implying that if he were a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him, but they did not believe that he was a real prophet. They told him to prophecy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the irony would not be understood here, the soldier's words could be translated more directly as, &ldquo;You are not a prophet - you cannot even tell us who struck you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   When Jesus heard it, he said to them, &ldquo;Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&rdquo; -Mark 2:17a (WEB)
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  When Jesus spoke here of righteous people, that was irony. Jesus knew that there are no righteous people. But some people thought that they really were righteous, and they didn't think that Jesus should allow sinners to follow him. But Jesus invited sinners to go to him and turn from their sins. He was not inviting people who think they are righteous and think that they do not need to turn from their sins. Only people who know that they are sinners would repent of their sins.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the irony would not be understood here, part of Mark 2:17 could be translated as &ldquo;I have not come to call those who think they are righteous to repentance, but those who know they are sinners.&rdquo;
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit5" id="examples-from-english">Examples from English</h6>

 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   &ldquo;The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000, so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work, and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired.
   <em class="u">
    Great bargain. Yeah, right
   </em>
   .&rdquo;
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In this example, the speaker uses irony to express that the reality of the car was totally different than what the car salesman said, so he repeats the car salesman's words, but now mocking them as false.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   &ldquo;Thanks for holding the door open for me.&rdquo;
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This would be an ironic statement made to someone who did not hold the door open for the speaker. It expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that the speaker is annoyed with that person for not doing that. The expression of thanks for something that both the hearer and the speaker know that the hearer did not do has become, through irony, a rebuke for not doing it.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="parts-of-a-sentence">Parts of a Sentence</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  A basic sentence has three important parts: subject, object, and verb.  Both subjects and objects are usually nouns (i.e. a person, place, thing, or idea). Verbs show action or a &ldquo;state of being.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The subject (which will be a noun: a person, place, thing, or idea) is usually  the main &ldquo;actor&rdquo; in a sentence.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The &ldquo;actor&rdquo; or subject usually does some action or is being described in some way.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When the subject is identified, determine what it is doing (or what is happening to it).
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    A subject may be active: it can
    <strong>
     perform
    </strong>
    or
    <strong>
     do
    </strong>
    something such as &ldquo;sing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;work,&rdquo; or &ldquo;teach.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    A subject can be in a
    <strong>
     state
    </strong>
    such as &ldquo;happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;sad,&rdquo; or &ldquo;mad.&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1 node">
   <div class="li">
    Or a subject may have something done to it.
   </div>
   <ul>
    <li class="level2">
     <div class="li">
      For example, &ldquo;The ball was thrown.&rdquo; (The ball is the subject.)
     </div>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The object of a sentence is a recipient (that is NOT the subject).  The object will also be a person, place, thing, or idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a simple sentence the subject usually does something to or towards an object. Consider the sentence:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;The boy kicked the ball.&rdquo;
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The boy is the
  <strong>
   subject
  </strong>
  ; the recipient or
  <strong>
   object
  </strong>
  is the ball.  The subject (boy) does some
  <strong>
   action
  </strong>
  (kicked) to the object (ball).The VERB tells what the action is that the subject is doing (or being).
 </p>
 <p>
  Often it is easy to find the verb, because one looks for the action occurring in the sentence.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="translation-suggestions">Translation Suggestions</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  All languages have a preferred word order. Translate sentences so that they are accurate and have a smooth flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Word order or patterns can vary if the sentence:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    is a question
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    has descriptive words
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    has a place in it
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    has time in it
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    has a condition in it, such as the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    is a poem
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Sometimes the word order will also vary if there is a special type of emphasis. For example, perhaps in your language there is a special way to ask a rhetorical question or give a command. Knowing the preferred word order of the source text and how it is different than the target language can help a translator in translating from that language into the target language. This is especially true if your language does not have the same pattern. If the two languages have a different preferred word order for communicating the same things, then you will need to rephrase the sentence into the order that is preferred in the target language in order to make your translation sound natural. The translator&rsquo;s goal is always to use natural language to make the meaning clear.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit4" id="language-examples">Language Examples</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Now we will look at the importance of word order.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="english">English</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  In English, &ldquo;The boy kicked the ball&rdquo;. &ldquo;The boy&rdquo; is the subject, &ldquo;kicked&rdquo; is the verb, and &ldquo;the ball&rdquo; is the object.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the basic word order that English uses to communicate statements. First we say the subject, then the verb, and then the object. We can represent the Subject, Verb and Object with the letters &ldquo;S&rdquo;, &ldquo;V&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo;. So, we can call English an
  <strong>
   SVO
  </strong>
  Language.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="japanese-chines-dutch-and-turkish">Japanese, Chines, Dutch and Turkish</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  In the Japanese, Chinese, Dutch, and Turkish languages usually the subject is first, and then the object comes next, followed by the verb.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the basic word order for a simple sentence for these languages is: Subject &ndash; Object &ndash; Verb, or SOV.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="hebrew-and-arabic">Hebrew and Arabic</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  In the Hebrew and Arabic languages, the order for sentences is normally Verb &ndash; Subject &ndash; Object, or VSO.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to translate from one of these languages into another, it is very important to change the order of the sentence into the preferred order for the target language. Only by doing this will the translation be natural and clear.

If they are speaking to one person, they use the &lsquo;singular&rsquo; form of &ldquo;you.&rdquo; If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the &ldquo;plural&rdquo; form of &ldquo;you.&rdquo; Some languages have a &ldquo;dual&rdquo; form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

  Some languages also have different forms of &ldquo;you&rdquo; to indicate respect or social distance. They use the formal form of &ldquo;you&rdquo; when addressing someone who is an elder or respected or in authority. They use the informal &ldquo;you&rdquo; when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Because the Bible was written in languages that do not have this difference, the translator will need to decide when it is best to use formal or informal forms of the language.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="forms-of-you-in-the-bible">Forms of "You" in the Bible</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. Therefore we know when each &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the Bible should be
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#forms-of-you-singular" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular">
   'singular'
  </a>
  or plural. But even when reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of &ldquo;you,&rdquo; the context will often make it clear whether the word &ldquo;you&rdquo; is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people. If the target language has a dual form of &ldquo;you&rdquo; that is used for speaking to only two people, the translator will need to decide from the context when it is appropriate to use this form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some languages, like English, have only one word for &lsquo;you&rsquo; regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as &lsquo;you&rsquo; or to many people as &lsquo;you.&rsquo; Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word &lsquo;you&rsquo; refers to one person or more than one.  Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the number of people who are being spoken to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some languages have more than one word for &lsquo;you&rsquo; depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the &lsquo;singular&rsquo; form of &lsquo;you&rsquo;. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the
  <span class="curid">
   <a class="wikilink1" href="#forms-of-you-dualplural" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual">
    &lsquo;plural&rsquo;

  form of &lsquo;you.&rsquo;  Some languages have a
  <span class="curid">
   <a class="wikilink1" href="#forms-of-you-dualplural" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual">
    &lsquo;dual&rsquo;

  form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="translation-suggestions">Translation Suggestions</h6>

 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.&rdquo; And [Jesus] said to them, &ldquo;What do
    <em class="u">
     you
    </em>
    want me to do for
    <em class="u">
     you
    </em>
    ?&rdquo;
   </em>
   -Mark 10:35-36
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Jesus is asking the
  <strong>
   two
  </strong>
  , James and John, what they want him to do for them. If the target language has a dual form of &ldquo;you,&rdquo; it would be appropriate to use it here. If the target language does not have a dual form, then the plural form would be appropriate.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &hellip;Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, &ldquo;Go to the village ahead of
    <em class="u">
     you
    </em>
    , and just as
    <em class="u">
     you
    </em>
    enter it,
    <em class="u">
     you
    </em>
    will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
   </em>
   -Mark 11:1-2
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of &ldquo;you&rdquo; would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs &ldquo;go&rdquo; and &ldquo;untie&rdquo; would also need the dual form.
 </p>
 <p>
  In instructional text, the &ldquo;you&rdquo; is often
  <strong>
   plural
  </strong>
  since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    Since
    <em class="u">
     you
    </em>
    call on a Father who judges each man&rsquo;s work impartially, live
    <em class="u">
     your
    </em>
    lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
   </em>

    still lack one thing. Sell everything

   </em>
   -Luke 18:21, 22
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Note that even though English does not have singular and plural forms of &lsquo;you&rsquo;, the context indicates that this word &lsquo;you&rsquo; here only refers to one person. The man had just told Jesus &ldquo;
  <em class="u">
   I
  </em>
  have observed these things&rdquo; and Jesus responded with &ldquo;you&rdquo;, referring only to that one man.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    Then the angel said to him, &ldquo;Put on

   </em>
   -Acts 12:8
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The context makes it clear that the angel is addressing one person, so the singular form of &ldquo;you&rdquo; would be used here in languages that make that distinction. The verbs &ldquo;put on&ldquo; and &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; would also need the singular form.
 </p>

 <p>
  Sometimes instruction is addressed to only one person, so the singular form of &ldquo;you&ldquo; would be used. The context will make that clear. This often happens in a letter.

  This module answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?
  <br/>
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="definition">Definition</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called
  <strong>
   <em>
    explicit
   </em>
  </strong>
  and the other is called
  <em>
   <strong>
    implicit
   </strong>
  </em>
  . When a speaker, or writer, has a message to give, he has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Information that the speaker states clearly is called
    <strong>
     <em>
      explicit
     </em>
    </strong>
    information. This is the information that the speaker or writer has decided to include in what he says.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Information that the speaker does not state clearly is called
    <em>
     <strong>
      implicit
     </strong>
    </em>
    information. This is the information that the speaker or writer expects his audience to already know, and so he knows that he does not need to include that information in what he writes.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When a writer writes, he has in mind a certain audience who will read what he writes. The writer has a good idea of what this audience does and does not know about what he is writing about, and so the writer chooses to include the important information that he knows his audience does not know. He chooses to not include the information that his audience already knows.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="translation-suggestions">Translation Suggestions</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Although implicit information is not stated in words but is only implied, it is information that the hearer or reader needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker or writer has succeeded in communicating his message only if the hearer or reader correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.
 </p>
 <p>
  When we translate the Bible, we are making it available to a new audience. This new audience will know some things about what is in the Bible, but often they will not know some of the implicit information that the original writer left out because his original audience already knew it. The new target audience, then, will need to know some of that implicit information in order to understand some parts of the text. So in order for the Bible to communicate its message successfully, the translator needs to include some of the information that the original writer left as implicit for the original audience. If this information can be included in just a few words, then the translator may decide to include this information in the text of the translation. But if it will take more than a few words, it is best to include this information in a footnote. The translator will need to think about his target audience and decide when to include some of this implicit information. Checking the translation with the community is a good way for the translator to find out where he needs to include some implicit information so that they can understand the translation.

  This module answers the question: How do I make implicit information explicit?
  <br/>
  Before you start this module have you learned about:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <a class="wikilink1" href="#explicit-and-implicit" title="en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit">

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="explanation">Explanation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  When a writer writes a message, he includes the information that his audience needs to know, and leaves out the information that he knows that they already know. When we translate a message, such as the Bible, for a new audience, they may not know some of that information that the original writer did not say. That is the implicit information. Because the author is counting on the audience knowing this implicit information, this information is also part of the message, even though it is not stated. So in the places where the target audience needs to know the implicit information in order to understand the text, and they do not know it, you must put it in the translation, either in the text or in a footnote.
 </p>
 <p>
  But translators need to be particularly sensitive when thinking about adding such information to the translation that is not stated explicitly in the source text because:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Sometimes there will be things that are intentionally unclear in the text. In those cases, the translator should try to keep it unclear also in the translation, if it is possible to keep it unclear in the same way.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    It is not necessary to include all implicit information for the target audience to understand the text. There is a lot of information that the original audience knew about the things that are in the Bible. Only include the information that the target audience needs to know so that the message is clear, nothing more.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The translator's goal should be to make sure that the reader understands the original meaning of the message. The translation should always have the same meaning as the source text had for its original audience, not more meaning, not less meaning, and not different meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Implicit information may be made explicit in order to make the translation clear if:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Only the implicit information that the original audience would have known is made explicit,
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    the added information is necessary so that the target audience will understand the main point of the message,
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    The translation would communicate no meaning or a wrong meaning without the added information,
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    No new information is added that is not part of the original message (do not add something just because you read it in a commentary),
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    the added information does not change the meaning, making it no longer true or accurate,
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    the added information is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As always, you need to ask yourself if your translation is communicating accurately and clearly what the original message was saying.
 </p>

   </em>
   -Ruth 2:14
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Some languages may need to add an object where English (or whatever source language is being used) doesn't have one. Here, the implied object is &ldquo;roasted grain&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;food.&rdquo; If the target language requires an object for these verbs, you could translate,
  <em>
   She ate all
   <em class="u">
    the roasted grain
   </em>
   that she wanted and had some
   <em class="u">
    food
   </em>
   left over.

 <blockquote>

    So Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.
   </em>
   -Genesis 11:5
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The phrase &ldquo;came down&rdquo; refers to
  <strong>
   where
  </strong>
  he came from. The place he came from was understood by the original readers. But if this sentence is unclear for the target audience, you may name the place to make the information explicit as in:
  <em>
   So Yahweh came down
   <em class="u">
    from heaven
   </em>
   to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.
  </em>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    These latter five kings joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).
   </em>
   -Genesis 14:3
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The information that the armies of the five kings were with these five kings was understood by the original readers. But if this information is not understood by the target audience, the information that their armies were with them can be made explicit: &ldquo;These latter five kings
  <em class="u">
   and their armies
  </em>
  joined together&hellip;.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   <em>
    To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael.
   </em>
   -Genesis 4:18
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It is stated explicitly that Enoch had a child named Irad and that Irad had a child named Mehujael. The implied information is that Irad grew up to be a man and married a woman and through her, had a son. If the verse is confusing without this information for the target audience, you may add as much information as is necessary, such as, &ldquo;Enoch grew up and married and became the father of a son whom he named Irad. When Irad grew up he became the father of a son whom he named Mehujael.&rdquo;

  Something that is hypothetical is 'assumed' or 'supposed.' A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. A hypothetical situation in the past did not happen, but could have happened under different circumstances. A hypothetical situation in the present or future may or may not actually happen - the speaker presents it as hypothetical because he does not know or it depends on the actions of others. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; question. It might be a &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; or &ldquo;if only&rdquo; statement. Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them in his teaching.

 <p>
  It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (e.g. past, present or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true; that it could possibly happen or would never happen.  Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons. Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; or &ldquo;if only&rdquo; to help the reader understand the type of hypothetical situation.  Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.

 <p>
  1. Consider a hypothetical situation that
  <strong>
   would never happen
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  In Luke chapter 18 verse 25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God&rsquo;s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God&rsquo;s rule in their life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hypothetical part of this is that a large camel could never squeeze through the eye of a very small sewing needle! Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to emphasize his teaching point.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Consider a &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; scenario that
  <strong>
   could possibly happen
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In Matthew chapter 12 verse 11, Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. He told them, &ldquo;Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Certainly, you would work to pull it out of the hole!&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jesus wasn&rsquo;t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather, he was talking about a possible situation which could and often did happen. He used the hypothetical story to help listeners understand his own work (God's work).
 </p>
 <p>
  3. The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario
  <strong>
   in the past
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  In Matthew 11:21, Jesus said that
  <em>
   if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he &ndash; Jesus &ndash; performed, they would have repented long ago.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen. Jesus was making the spiritual teaching point of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; these people had seen the miracles? If they had seen the miracles, then, they would have repented.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Often a hypothetical situation in the past
  <strong>
   expresses an emotion, such as regret
  </strong>
  . For example, consider Exodus 16:3:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   &ldquo;
   <em>
    If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt&hellip;
   </em>
   .&rdquo;
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Here the Israelites are afraid that they will have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they are wishing that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.

 <p>
  In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. Many languages do this by using different tenses or time words such as &lsquo;earlier,&rsquo; &lsquo;last year,&rsquo; or &lsquo;before that.&rsquo; Other languages prefer to state the events in the order that they occurred to avoid confusion. For events that are told in the order in which they occurred, it is also necessary in many languages to mark the order of events with connecting words such as &ldquo;after these things,&rdquo; &ldquo;having done this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;then.&rdquo; It is important to help your readers understand the correct order of events in a natural way when translating into your language.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="translation-suggestions">Translation Suggestions</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  In order to make the order of events clear in the target language, it may be necessary at times to put some verses or parts of verses in a different order. When you put verses in a different order, you may need to combine the verse numbers so that the numbers can stay in the right order, such as labelling a chunk of two reordered verses as 5-6. You should only put verses in a different order when necessary to avoid confusion or wrong meaning. The translation should always be clear, accurate, and natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pay close attention to time words such as, &ldquo;yesterday,&rdquo; &ldquo;last year,&rdquo; &ldquo;before,&rdquo; &ldquo;then,&rdquo; or &ldquo;next year.&rdquo;  Make sure that you include all of the time words necessary for your audience to understand the order of events. It is also important that your audience understand clearly the order of arguments, such as reasons or causes. Some languages put the reasons or causes for things before the event or the main point of an argument, and other languages put reasons and causes after the main point or event. Use whichever order is natural for your language. It may also be helpful to use words such as,  &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; or &ldquo;because.&rdquo;
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit4" id="examples-from-the-bible">Examples from the Bible</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Following the Greek wording, the English Standard Version of Luke 10:34 says,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;He (The Samaritan) went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine&ldquo; (ESV).
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This could sound like the Samaritan bandaged the wounds and then poured oil and wine on the bandages or that he did all of this at the same time. To make the order of what happened more clear, you might consider rearranging the phrases in this sentence to read,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;The Samaritan went to him, poured oil and wine on his wounds, and put bandages on them.&rdquo;
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Sometimes to emphasize a point or highlight a contrast between two events, the Bible text presents things in a different order than they occurred. The ESV of Luke 8:37-38 says,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    37 &ldquo;&hellip;So he (Jesus) got into the boat and returned (to the other side of the lake). 38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying&hellip;&rdquo;
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In verse 37, it sounded like Jesus had already left in the boat, but in the next verse the man is talking to him. We need to understand that the man spoke to Jesus before Jesus left. Luke first talked about the people begging Jesus to leave and Jesus' response to them in verse 37, then he talked about the man begging Jesus to go with him and Jesus' response to the man in verse 38. Luke is showing us the contrast between the two kinds of people. This is a Greek language pattern that is not natural in English because the events are out of order. Some languages will have to make the order of events clear by saying,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    &ldquo;Before Jesus left, the man said to him&hellip;.&rdquo;
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Other languages may need to switch the order of the verses:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="no">
   <em>
    37-38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying&hellip;then he got into the boat and returned (to the other side of the lake)&rdquo;.
   </em>
  </div>
 </blockquote>

  Typically people start each day by doing the same steps. For example,
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Wake up
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Get out of bed
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Get dressed
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  English prefers telling events in the order that they occur. So for English we would not say, &ldquo;Every morning I get dressed, wake up, and get out of bed.&rdquo; The preferred order would be, &ldquo;Every morning when I wake up, I get out of bed and get dressed.&rdquo;

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="explanation">Explanation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The kind of communication that we call &ldquo;parable&rdquo; includes narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs, and even riddles. The intent of a parable is to convey meaning through a story or word picture. A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like an imaginary or hypothetical example (e.g. This could happen). It can be used to explain the kingdom of Heaven by telling a story which the listeners can understand.  Because the lesson comes in the form of a story, the listener or reader can feel themselves being a part of it; it is more likely to make an impact on their lives.
 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit3" id="translation-suggestions">Translation Suggestions</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Parables or teaching stories are best translated as closely as possible to the way they were originally told. Because the parables are set in the culture of Bible times, there may be things that are not easily understood by a modern audience. Follow the guidelines for translating unknown practices or things. But because these are parables and not real events, some things that are known to the target audience can be substituted for things that are unknown to them, as long as they existed in the time period. Parables are best translated as a situation that can be understood within your own culture. The parable is a teaching story, so it is important that all of the details and parts of the story support the main point of the story. It is important that you understand this main point of the parable before you translate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Jesus told a parable, he did not always intend for his hearers to understand what it meant right away (for example, the parable of the farmer planting seeds). So do
  <em class="u">
   not
  </em>
  try to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply translate the parable. Use the form that your language has for communicating that a narrative is an imaginative story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Parables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account.)

  This manual describes how to check translated biblical content for accuracy, clarity, and naturalness.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Volume One
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Volume One contains instructions for checking the translation that the translation team will use to check each other's work. If they follow these instructions, they will complete checking level one. Volume One also contains instructions for the translation team to use for checking the translation with the language community for clarity and naturalness, and for church leaders to use when they check the translation for accuracy. If they follow these instructions, they will complete checking level two. This volume also contains instructions for the leaders of church networks to use for checking the translation for accuracy at level three.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Volume Two
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Volume Two contains further instructions for checking the translation that the leaders of church networks can use to check the translation. Because many leaders of church networks do not speak the language of the translation, Volume Two also contains instructions for creating a back translation, which allows people to check a translation in a language that they do not speak.

<div class="level4">
 <p>
  As part of the translation process, it is necessary that several people check the translation to make sure that it is clearly communicating the message that it should communicate. A beginning translator who was told to check his translation once said, &ldquo;But I speak my native language perfectly. The translation is for that language. What more is needed?&rdquo; What he said was true, but there are two more things to keep in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing is that he may not have understood the source text correctly, and so someone who knows what it should say might be able to correct the translation. This could be because he did not correctly understand a phrase or expression in the source language. In this case, someone else who understands the source language well can correct the translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or it could be that he did not understand something about what the Bible meant to communicate at a certain place. In this case, someone who knows the Bible well, such as a Bible teacher or a Bible translation checker, can correct the translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other thing is that, although the translator may know very well what the text should say, the way he translated it might mean something else to a different person. That is, another person might think that the translation is talking about something other than what the translator intended, or the person hearing or reading the translation might not understand what the translator was trying to say. That is why it is always necessary to check what someone else understands from the translation so that we can make it more accurate and more clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a guide to the process of checking, in the form of a scale with three levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  This checking scale helps to show the extent to which the accuracy and clarity of a translation have been verified. These checking levels have been developed by the
  <a class="urlextern" href="https://unfoldingword.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://unfoldingword.org">

  (

  </a>
  ), the same group that manages Door43 with the help of many volunteers, and they are used to indicate the checking level of all biblical content on Door43.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="the-checking-levels">The Checking Levels</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  There are three checking levels:

   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Any translation that has not yet been checked to Level One is considered to have not been checked and is assigned no checking status.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of having several Checking Levels is to make translated materials quickly available to the church, while also allowing the content to continue to be checked and corroborated in an open environment. At all times, the degree to which its accuracy has been checked will be clearly indicated. We believe this will result in a faster checking process, allow broad church participation and ownership, and produce better translations.

    When a Checking Level has been completed and all appropriate edits have been made to the translation on door43, the checkers will inform unfoldingWord of the details of the check, including who did the checking and their title or qualifications as a translation checker. unfoldingWord will then harvest a copy of what is on door43, digitally publish a static copy of it on the

Feedback loops are encouraged (and modeled in translation software, where feasible) with a view to maximizing input from the greatest number of users of the content. The translations of the content are made available on the (

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The goal of checking is to help the translation team produce a translation that is accurate, natural, clear, and accepted by the church. The translation team also wants to achieve this goal. This might seem easy, but it is actually very difficult to do, and takes many people and many, many revisions to the translation to achieve. For this reason, the checkers play a very important role in helping the translation team to produce a translation that is accurate, natural, clear, and accepted by the church.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="accurate">Accurate</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  The checkers who are pastors, church leaders, and leaders of church networks will help the translation team produce a translation that is accurate. They will do this by comparing the translation with the source language and, when possible, also with the original languages of the Bible. For more information about accurate translations, see

  The checkers who are members of the language community will help the translation team produce a translation that is clear. They will do this by listening to the translation and pointing out to them the places where the translation is confusing or does not make sense to them.

 </p>
</div>
<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="explanation">Explanation</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The Church in each people group has the authority to decide for themselves what is and what is not a good quality translation of the Bible in their language. Authority to check and approve a Bible translation (which is constant) is separate from capacity, or the ability to carry out the process of checking a Bible translation (which can be increased). The authority for determining quality belongs to the Church, independent of their current ability, experience, or access to resources that facilitate the checking of Bible translations. So while the church in a language group has the authority to check and approve their own Bible translation, the unfoldingWord tools, including these modules of translationAcademy, are designed to ensure that the church also has the capacity to check the quality of their Bible translation using an excellent process.
 </p>
 <p>
  This model proposes a three-tiered approach to affirming the quality of a translation, designed to reflect three general levels of Church authority within a people group:
 </p>

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The intent of this level is to affirm the agreement of the translation team with standard Christian doctrine, as well as with the guidelines for ensuring the accuracy of the translation itself. Content published at this level promotes the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to members of the language community to suggest improvements to the translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  To achieve this level, the translation team asserts that the
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#statement-of-faith" title="en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith">
   Statement of Faith
  </a>
  is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that the translated content is also in harmony with it.

  At this level, the model implements the concept of a &ldquo;testimony of two or three witnesses&rdquo; in the checking process.
 </p>
 <p>
  To achieve this level, the translation team will submit the translation to members of the language community that will use the translation. The language community will review the translation for
  <strong>
   clarity

  and
  <strong>
   naturalness

 <p>
  The translation team will then submit the translation to church leaders from the language community that will use the translation. These church leaders will review the translation for
  <strong>
   accuracy

 <p>
  To achieve this level, the translation team will submit the translation for review by the highest leadership of the Church that speaks the language. It is best if these leaders represent as many of the major groups of churches that exist in the language community as possible. Level 3 is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the leadership of multiple church networks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The translation team will edit the translation so that the leadership of these church networks affirm that it is an accurate translation and will be accepted by their church fellowships.

It is best if you can do this on a chart so that you can list the source term in one column and the target term in another column. Further columns could list equivalent terms in other languages and the references where these terms occur in the Bible.

The purpose of this step is to make sure that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original story or Bible passage. The checkers will be helping the translation team think about the best way to translate the meaning of the story or Bible passage in their own language. There can be one person who checks a story or Bible passage, or more than one. Having more than one person checking a story or passage can be helpful, because often different checkers will notice different things.

<div class="level4">
 <p>
  The people who do the Level Two or Level Three accuracy check should not be members of the translation team. They should be church leaders who speak the language of the translation and who know the Bible well in the source language. It is true that the language community members who checked the translation for naturalness and clarity were not allowed to look at the source while they were doing their checking. But for accuracy testing, the new translation
  <em>
   must be compared with the source text, or with the source in the original biblical languages
  </em>
  .
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="all-levels">All Levels</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  The people doing the checking should follow these steps:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Each of the checkers should read the translation (or listen to the recording) by himself, comparing it to the original Bible passage or story in the language of wider communication. It can be helpful for the translator to read the translation out loud to the checker while the checker follows along looking at the source Bible or Bibles. As the checker reads (or listens to) the translation and compares it to the source, he should keep in mind these general questions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Does the translation add anything to the original meaning?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Is there any part of the meaning that is left out of the translation?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Has the translation changed the meaning in any way?
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These questions can also be helpful for finding anything that might be inaccurate in the translation:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Was everything that was mentioned in the source language translation also mentioned in the flow of the new (local) translation? (Did the meaning of the new translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the source translation? Sometimes if the arrangement of words or the order of ideas is different than in the source translation, it sounds better that way and is still accurate.)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the source language translation? (Was it easy to see who was doing the events of the new translation when it was compared to the source language?)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Are there Important Terms used in the new translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the source version? (Think about things like this: How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or a temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a word borrowed from the source language?)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Are the phrases used in the new translation helpful in understanding the more difficult phrases of the source translation? (Are the phrases of the new translation put together in a way that brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the source language translation?)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Another way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions about the translation, such as, &ldquo;who did what, when, where, how, and why.&rdquo; There are questions that have already been prepared to help with this. Click for
    <a class="wikilink1" href="https://unfoldingword.org/translationquestions/" title="en:obs:notes:questions:home">

    <a class="wikilink1" href="/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home" title="en:bible:questions:comprehension:home">
     Bible questions
    </a>
    . The answers to those questions should be the same as the answers to those questions about the source language translation. If they are not, there is a problem in the translation.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  2. The checker should make notes where he thinks there might be a problem or something to be improved. Each checker will discuss these notes with the translation team.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. After the checkers have checked a Bible Story or chapter individually, they should all meet with the translator or translation team and review the story or Bible passage together. As they come to the places where each checker made note of a problem or question, the checkers can ask their questions or make suggestions for improvement. As the checkers and the translation team discuss the questions and suggestions, they might think of other questions or new ways of saying things. This is good. As the checkers and the translation team work together, God will help them discover the best way to communicate the meaning of the story or Bible passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. After the checkers and the translation team have decided what they need to change, the translation team will revise the translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  5. After the translation team revises the translation, they should read it out loud to each other or to other members of the language community to make sure that it still sounds natural in their language.
 </p>
 <p>
  6. The translator (or team) makes a note of any Bible passages that are still difficult to understand, and where they would like additional help from other Bible checkers. These notes will be used by the church leaders and checkers in levels two and three, so that they can help the translators understand the meaning and communicate it more clearly.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  After you, the translation team, have performed the checks listed under Level One, you are ready to take the translation to the community so that you can check to see if it communicates the message clearly and naturally to them in the target language.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this check you will read a section of the translation to members of the language community. Before you read the translation, tell the people listening that you want them to stop you if they hear something that is not natural in their language. For more information on how to check a translation for naturalness, click
  <a class="wikilink1" href="#natural-translation" title="en:ta:vol1:checking:natural">

 </p>
 <p>
  There are a set of questions and answers for each Open Bible Story and for each chapter of the Bible that you can use to test the translation to make sure that it is communicating clearly.
 </p>
 <ul>

   <div class="li">

     Bible questions are here
    </a>
    .
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  To use these questions, follow these steps:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Read the passage of the translation to one or more members of the language community who will answer the questions. These members of the language community must be people who have not been involved in the translation before. In other words, the community members who are asked the questions should not already know the answers to the questions from working on the translation or from previous knowledge of the Bible. We want them to be able to answer the questions only from hearing or reading the translation of the story or Bible passage. This is how we will know if the translation is communicating clearly or not. For this same reason, it is important that the community members not look at a Bible while they are answering these questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Ask the community members some of the questions for that passage, one question at a time. It is not necessary to use all of the questions for each story or chapter if it seems that the community members are understanding the translation well.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. After each question, a member of the language community will answer the question. If the person only answers with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no,&rdquo; then the questioner should ask a further question so that he can be sure that the translation is communicating well. A further question could be something like, &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What part of the translation tells you that?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Write down the answer that the person gives. If the person&rsquo;s answer is similar to the suggested answer that has been provided for the question, then the translation of the story is clearly communicating the right information at that point. The answer does not have to be exactly the same as the suggested answer to be a right answer, but it should give basically the same information. Sometimes the suggested answer is very long. If the person answers with only part of the suggested answer, that is also a right answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  5. If the answer is unexpected or very different than the suggested answer, or if the person cannot answer the question, then the translation team will need to revise the part of the translation that communicates that information so that it communicates the information more clearly.
 </p>
 <p>
  6. After the translation team has revised the translation of the passage, then ask other members of the language community the same questions, that is, ask other speakers of the language who have not been involved in checking the same passage before. If they answer the questions correctly, then the translation is now communicating well.
 </p>
 <p>
  7. Repeat this process with each story or Bible chapter until members of the language community can answer the questions well, showing that the translation is communicating the right information clearly. The translation is ready for the church check of level 2 when language community members who have not heard the translation before can answer the questions correctly.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  After the translation has been checked by community members for clarity, it will be checked by a group of church leaders for accuracy. This group must consist of at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and who understand well one of the languages in which the source text is available. They should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with, the translator (or translation team). Usually these reviewers will be pastors of church congregations. These church leaders should represent the different churches in the language community. That is, it is best to include church leaders from different church networks. We recommend that the group include church leaders from three different church networks, if the community has that many.
 </p>
 <p>
  These reviewers should follow these steps:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">

  As well as asking questions, there are other checking methods that you may also use to ensure that the translation is easy to read and sounds natural to the listeners. Here are some other methods that you may like to try:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Retell Method
    </strong>
    :  You, the translator or tester, can read a few verses and ask someone else to retell what was said. This helps to check the clarity and naturalness of the translation and offers alternate ways of saying the same thing.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Reading Method
    </strong>
    : Someone other than you, the translator or tester, should read a portion of the translation while you take notes where the pauses and mistakes occur. This will show how easy or how difficult it is to read and understand the translation. Look at the places in the translation where the reader paused or made mistakes and consider what part of the translation was difficult. You may need to revise the translation at those points so that it is easier to read and understand.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Offer Alternate translations
    </strong>
    : In areas where you are not sure of the best way to express a word or phrase, ask other people for an alternative translation or offer a choice between two translations and see which alternative translation people think is the most clear.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Reviewer Input
    </strong>
    : Let others whom you respect read your translation. Ask them to take notes and tell you where it might be improved. Look for better word choices, natural expressions, and even spelling adjustments.
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Discussion Groups
    </strong>
    : Ask people to read the translation aloud in a group of people and allow them and others to ask questions for clarification. Pay attention to the words they use, since alternate words and expressions come up when someone is trying to make sense of a difficult point, and these alternate words and expressions might be better than the ones in the translation. Pay attention to the places where people do not understand the translation, and work to make those places clearer.

For this section of testing, do not compare the new translation with the source language translation. If there is a problem at any place, make a note of it so that you can discuss the problem with the translation team at a later time.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable? (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)

   <div class="li">
    Do your community members use the words and expressions found in the translation, or has the translator borrowed many words from the national language? (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)

    One way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section. If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear.

 <p>
  To translate the Bible so that it is NATURAL means that:
 </p>
 <p>
  The translation should sound like it was written by a member of the target language community&mdash;not by a foreigner.
 </p>
 <p>
  To check a translation for naturalness, it is not helpful to compare it to the source language. During this check for naturalness, no one should look at the source language Bible. People will look at the source language Bible again for other checks, such as the check for accuracy, but not during this check.
 </p>
 <p>
  To check a translation for naturalness, you or another member of the language community must read it out loud. You can read it to one other person who speaks the target language or to a group of people. Before you start reading, tell the people listening that you want them to stop you when they her something that does not sound like the way someone from your language community would say it. When someone stops you, then you can discuss together how someone would say that same thing in a more natural way.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is helpful to think about a situation in your village in which people would talk about the same kind of thing that the translation is talking about. Imagine people that you know talking about that thing, and then say it out loud in that way. If others agree that that is a good and natural way to say it, then write it that way in the translation.

  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Is the translation written in a way that can be understood easily by both young and old members of the language community?

   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Is the style of this translation more formal or informal? (Is the manner of speaking the way that the local community prefers, or should it be more or less formal?)
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Does the translation use too many words that were borrowed from another language, or are these words acceptable to the language community?
   </div>
  </li>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    Did the writer use an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community? (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Did the writer use a form of the language that all of the language community understands well, or did he use a form that is used in only a small area?

    Is the translation missing any of its parts? In other words, does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?

    Does the translation include all the verses of the book that was translated? (When you look at the verse numbering of the source language translation, are all of the verses included in the target language translation?) Sometimes there are differences in verse numbering between translations. For example, in some translations some verses are grouped together or sometimes certain verses are put in footnotes. Even though there may be these kinds of differences between the source translation and the target translation, the target translation is still considered to be complete.

<h6 class="sectionedit2" id="self-assessment-of-translation-quality">Self-assessment of Translation Quality</h6>
<div class="level3">
 <p>
  The objective of this section is to describe a process by which the Church can reliably determine for themselves the quality of a translation. This following assessment is intended to suggest some of the most important techniques for checking a translation, rather than to describe every conceivable check that could be employed. Ultimately, the decision of what checks are used, when, and by whom should be made by the Church.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="how-to-use-the-assessment">How to Use the Assessment</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  This assessment method employs two types of statements. Some are &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; statements where a negative response indicates a problem that must be resolved. Other sections use an equally-weighted method that provides translation teams and checkers with statements about the translation. Each statement should be scored by the person doing the check (beginning with the translation team) on a scale of 0-2:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   0
  </strong>
  - disagree
  <br/>
  <strong>
   1
  </strong>
  - agree somewhat
  <br/>
  <strong>
   2
  </strong>
  - strongly agree
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the review, the total value of all responses in a section should be added up and, if the responses accurately reflect the state of the translation, this value will provide the reviewer with an approximation of the probability that the translated chapter is of excellent quality. The rubric is designed to be simple and provide the reviewer with an objective method to assess where the work needs improvement.
  <em>
   For example, if the translation scores relatively well in &ldquo;Accuracy&rdquo; but quite poorly in &ldquo;Naturalness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clarity,&rdquo; then the translation team needs to do more community checking.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The rubric is intended to be used for each chapter of translated biblical content. The translation team should do an assessment of each chapter after they finish their other checks, and then the level 2 church checkers should do it again, and then the level 3 checkers should also assess the translation with this checklist. As more detailed and extensive checking of the chapter is performed by the Church at each level, the points for the chapter should be updated from each of the first four sections (overview, naturalness, clarity, accuracy), allowing the church and community to see how the translation is improving.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Level One checking will be done primarily by the translation team, with some help from others in the language community. The translator or translation team should check their translation before they translate very many stories or chapters of the Bible, so that they can correct mistakes as early as possible in the translation process. Many of the steps in this process will need to be done several times before the translation is finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts and biblical content are able to be published after they reach Checking Level One. This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation to others in the language community (implied or direct) to help improve the translation.

  The purpose of Level Two checking is to verify that representative groups from the local language community agree that the translation is a good one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level Two checking will be done in two ways:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li class="level1">
   <div class="li">
    <strong>
     Language Community Check
    </strong>
    . The translation will be checked by members of the language community to make sure that it is clear, natural, and understandable. For the steps to follow to do the Language Community Check, click

  The community leaders might want to add their own information to this or make a summary statement about how acceptable this translation is to the local community. This can be included as part of the Level Two Community Check Evaluation information. The wider church leadership will have access to this information, and it will help them validate the translation as approved by the local Christian community when they do the Level Two Church check and also Level Three Checking.

<div class="level3">
 <p>
  Level Three checking will be done by groups or organizations that are recognized by the churches in a language community. The leaders from these groups will verify that they approve of the distribution and use of the translation among the people affiliated with them. This approval is not required for distribution of the translation, but rather serves to validate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who do Level Three checking need to be other than the people who did Level Two checking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intent of this level is to affirm the alignment of the translation with the intent of the original texts and the sound doctrine of the Church historic and universal, through the review and affirmation by the leadership of the Church that speaks the language. Level 3 is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the leadership of multiple church networks. The Church networks should be representative of the churches in the language community. Those checking the translation should be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check are those in leadership roles in the Church networks. A leader of a Church network who is also a first-language speaker of the language of the translation could both check the translation and sign off on its quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 3 is completed when the translation has been thoroughly checked and approved by the leadership (or their delegates) of at least two church networks that have personnel trained in biblical languages and content.
 </p>

  These are the questions for the Level Three checkers to keep in mind as they read the new translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can answer these questions after you read portions of the translation or as you come across problems in the text. If you answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any of these questions in the first group, please explain in more detail, include the specific passage that you feel is not right, and give your recommendation for how the translation team should correct it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep in mind that the goal of the translation team is to express the meaning of the source text in a natural and clear way in the target language. This means that they may have needed to change the order of some clauses and that they had to represent many single words in the source language with multiple words in the target language. These things are not considered to be problems.

 <p>
  If you answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to any of the questions in this second group, please explain in more detail so that the translation team can know what the specific problem is, what part of the text needs correction, and how you would like them to correct it.

  If you do not see your languages in the list of target languages, first try alternate spellings, dialect names, and any variant names for your language. If you still can't find it, you can request that your language be added. The best way to submit a request is to send an email to <a href="mailto:help@door43.org">help@door43.org</a>. Another method is to submit a Bug Report. In either case, please provide as much information as you can about the language, such as the local name of the language, any other names it is known by, approximate number of speakers, where it is spoken, what languages are similar to it, any published works in that language, etc.

  To help translators make the best translation possible, Translation Resources have been created. The Resources include Translation Notes, Important Terms, and Translation Questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Translation Notes
  </strong>
  are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Important Terms
  </strong>
  are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each Important Term has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories and the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Translation Questions
  </strong>
  are available for the translator to check their work. These questions can be asked of anyone checking the translation work. Read the question, answer the question from the information in the translated text, look at the answer. Do both of the answers match? Then the transaltion is clear and accurate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have consulted the Translation Resources, then you are ready to make the best translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Please use the Translation Resources when checking your translation!

<div class="level4">
 <p>
  When the Request to Publish is approved, the text is made available on unfoldingword.org for online viewing, as a downloadable, print-ready PDF, and it appear in the unfoldingWord app.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="can-text-be-changed-after-level-3-checking">Can Text Be Changed After Level 3 Checking?</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Approved text can always be modified in translationStudio even after all checking levels are completed, HOWEVER if you or another user were to submit a Request to Publish for text that has already completed Level 3 checking, there would be questions regarding the reason for overwriting the previously published and checked materials. The approver will look to see who contributed to the change and may contact the requestor and others involved with the translation of the text in question to ensure the changes are valid.
 </p>
</div>
<h7 id="must-all-contributors-be-named">Must All Contributors Be Named?</h7>
<div class="level4">
 <p>
  Due to copyright laws (and these exist no matter what country you are in and no matter what people tell you about laws in that country), you must list
  <em class="u">
   every
  </em>
  contributor on the Request to Publish form and provide a legal signature for each person. In certain cases we understand they cannot be named, however you can provide the established pseudonym for that person.

 </p>
 <p>
  At times the program may restart, also called a 'crash'. This is most likely not because of what the translator did. When this happens, the
  <strong>
   Feedback
  </strong>
  window will open and a request to type into the space an explanation of what was being done just before the program restarted.
 </p>
 <p>
  At other times, the translator may want to mention a problem with the program or content. For this, go to the Translating Editing Window and tap on the 3 dots found at the bottom left of the window. Choose
  <strong>
   Feedback
  </strong>
  from the list. Use the keyboard to type in an explanation of the problem that you have been experiencing.

  The Process Manual is a practical guide to help translation teams know what steps need to be taken from start to finish and how those steps are to be taken. While the Translation Manual is a how-to guide for translation theory and the Checking Manual is a how-to guide for checking theory and the Technology Manual is a how-to guide for using certain technology pieces, the Process Manual seeks to give a step-by-step process the translation team can follow. The Process Manual guides the translation team from initial setup to final publishing of translated and checked content.

  There are two translation platforms that we use - translationStudio and Door43. Once translations have been completed, we encourage these translations to be checked. Once a translation has been checked to at least Level 1, it becomes eligible to be published. Published content is placed on a platform where it remains static. While the content on Door43 can change frequently, the published content is static and assurance of quality remains high.
 </p>
 <p>
  When content is published, a copy of what is found on Door43 is published to the
  <a class="urlextern" href="https://unfoldingword.org/stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://unfoldingword.org/stories">

    - Immediately after submitting the Request to Publish form, a computerized check will take place. This check ensures that everything has been translated and that content appears in the correct web pages in Door43. It also does a statistical check which compares the standard deviation from the source language to the target language. Abnormally high or low deviations are flagged and all results of the &ldquo;pre-flight&rdquo; check are processed and returned to the requester within a minute or so.
